              "'1 \\n Budget Speech – 2024  \\nA Prelude to the Stable Future  \\nPreamble  \\nHonourable Speaker,  \\nThe Lord Buddha has elucidated on a concept called “ Samajeewikatha ” (balance \\nliving) . He explained this concept in the Vyagghapajja Sutta . The concept \\nelaborates on how to balance our budget.  \\nThe Buddha has advised against leading a pompous and extravagant life, while \\nreceiving a low income. He explains that a mindful person would lead his life in \\na way that his income is aligned with expenditure.  \\nWe should spend according to the income we receive. That is what the Buddhist \\neconomic philosophy demonstrates to us. But, for the majority of the 75 years \\nfollowing the independence, our spending has often diverged from our generated \\nrevenue. When I say t his, one might think that the governments of this country \\nspent lavishly and wasted money. Not just governments. The country as a whole \\nhas lived beyond its means.   \\nWe resorted to borrowing or printing money to provide jobs, increase salaries, \\ndistribute free rice, offer relief, and maintain state -owned enterprises. We won \\nelections by making promises about giving government jobs, safeguarding public \\nresources, delive ring relief packages, reducing commodity prices, and increasing \\nsalaries. We became indebted to the country as well as to the world to lead \\npompous and extravagant lives by not aligning revenue to our expenditure.  \\nIn the Samajjapala Sutta , the Lord Buddha has emphasized that we should borrow \\nfor investment rather than for consumption. But we borrowed for consumption. \\nIna Sutta  in Anguttara Chakka Nipatha  specifically points out that it is very \\ndangerous to borrow and pay interest in this manner.  \\nAfter 75 years of independence, we now find ourselves in a dire situation as a \\nresult of ignoring Samajeewikatha and the Buddhist economic philosophy. Our \\neconomy collapsed completely, leading us to a status of bankruptcy.  \\nWe fought over meagre litres of petrol. Conflicts emerged over obtaining a gas \\ncylinder. We remained in darkness for ten to fifteen hours a day. Our \\nsupermarkets began to sell firewood. Businesses collapsed. The tourism industry 2 \\n crumbled. Jobs were lost. Essential goods became scarce. There were queues \\neverywhere. All public transport failed. Schools were closed. We could not \\nconduct examinations. There was a food crisis due to the lack of fertilizer. The \\nsituation reached a point  where we felt as if we were left not with a country but \\nwe were in a state akin to hell.  \\nNo one stepped up to accept the challenge of rescuing the country in the face of \\nthis challenge. Instead, they gave up offering various excuses similar to those \\ngiven by Andare  when confronted with the task of lifting the rock. Some \\nindividuals turned to astrology for guidance, while others imposed conditions \\nthat could not be constitutionally accommodated.  \\nIt is under these circumstances that I assumed the responsibility of leading this \\nnation.  \\nAt the time, I took over a patient who was dying. A country that resembled a \\nliving hell. A derailed economy that had been brought to its knees.  \\nWe began to work day and night following a formal and systematic plan despite \\nnumerous obstacles and challenges. We strived to rescue the country from the \\nhellish conditions it was facing. Government employees demonstrated dedicated \\nhard work, contributing  to our endeavors to salvage the nation. All our friendly \\nnations took care of us and offered relief.  \\nAt this juncture, I openly communicated to all of you that I will work hard to \\nrevive the economy through a comprehensive reform programme and to liberate \\nthe people from the economic hardships. I was not the only one who contributed \\nto this hard work and commitment. Every citizen of this country strived for this. \\nThey were committed to achieve this. There were also certain segments who were \\nnot a part of this collective effort and who tried to pull the country further \\nbackward. But, we have now been able t o stabilize the country to a certain extent, \\ndampening their hopes.  \\nWe successfully redirected the economy, which was derailed and collapsed, to \\nget back on track. Several temporary measures were implemented, including the \\ntemporary suspension of imports, to achieve this. However, it is not advisable for \\nthe economy to sus tain such restrictions indefinitely. This is the moment to \\nimplement enduring and sustainable actions. To propel the economy forward, \\nthese actions must be undertaken. It is through these measures that we can fully \\nrejuvenate the economy, rescuing it from the brink of collapse.  3 \\n This is not an easy task. But we can do it. We can overcome this challenge by \\nembracing new concepts and following the path we have already embarked \\nupon.  \\nHistory has demonstrated that seeking solutions solely for political advantage, \\ndeviating from the principles of \" Samajeevikatha ,\" is not a successful approach. \\nWhy we would continue to do so when we are aware that such actions would be \\nunsuccessful?  \\nYou might tell fairy tales, but the progress of a country cannot be achieved \\nthrough such narratives. A country cannot be developed by making false \\npromises. The country moved backward because of the electoral promises made \\nby political parties throughout time. We have witnessed that the ultimate result \\nof this is the country becoming bankrupt. Unfortunately, many segments of the \\npopulation have not come to realize this yet.  \\nI beseech you that we should stop propagating lies for political motives. Let’s be \\nhonest with ourselves. Let’s think about the country rather than about our \\npolitics. Let’s get  together to uplift the country. Let’s think about the political \\nagendas when our country is strong.  \\nOur country’s situation is now better than what it was before one year. I am not \\nsaying that the economy has completely recovered. It has become comparatively \\nbetter. We have attained that position by facing difficulties, making sacrifices and \\nenduring var ious hardships.  \\nWe can certainly create a more favourable economic environment in the near \\nfuture if we gradually move forward in this difficult terrain. When we look back \\nat the past year, it is 100 percent confirmed that we are on the right track. The \\npeople in the coun try, who once struggled to obtain petrol, can now buy it \\nwithout being in a queue or without any limitations. The people who had to wait \\nin queues for weeks to obtain a gas cylinder can now purchase it with a single \\nphone call. People who endured power cut s for ten to twelve hours can now enjoy \\nuninterrupted power supply. The country where firewood was sold from \\nsupermarkets to retail shops has now completely transformed. This all means that \\nwe are on the right track. Our plans are sound. Our strategies are  effective. Hence, \\nlet’s continue the rest of the journey even amidst difficulties.  \\nAs we progressed along this path, there were certain mistakes. We have \\nacknowledged this. We will humbly rectify those deficiencies and mistakes.  4 \\n The economy which was derailed was put back on track. But this achievement \\nalone is not satisfactory. Just by this, we would not feel great relief or comfort. \\nOur difficult times have not ended. The entire country continues to grapple with \\nvarious hardship s in different aspects.  \\nAs we were able to reduce inflation up to a single -digit level, we could rescue the \\ncountry from the high inflationary pressures. But, we still could not \\ncorrespondingly increase salaries and income to match the high cost of living \\nwhich increased due to t his severe crisis. The increase in prices of fuel and \\nelectricity adversely impacted all households. The increase in tax rates has also \\nshaken up individuals and businesses, both small and large. Production costs \\nhave also escalated.  \\nWe are well aware of the difficulties faced by the people of this country. The path \\ntoward s a stable and developed economy is not beautiful. It is difficult, hard and \\nchallenging.  \\nReviving an economy in a state of bankruptcy is a formidable task. If we \\nsuccessfully navigate through this challenging period, we can create a free and \\ndecent society. Instead, if we continue to build sand castles by giving relief to the \\npeople based on political motives, the country will again be bankrupt.  \\nThe success of the path that we have undertaken thus far lies on the economic \\nreform programme that we commenced. This reform programme have laid the \\nfoundation to progress, steering us away from economic turmoil such as the one \\nexperienced in 2022.  \\nSince 2013, the practice of revising the electricity bill in accordance with the \\ngovernment expenditure on electricity generation has not been followed. Due to \\nthis, the Ceylon Electricity Board suffered enormous losses. Until 2022, loans were \\nobtained fro m the two -state banks to offset these losses. Similarly, the Ceylon \\nPetroleum Corporation which suffers unbelievable losses offsets its losses \\nthrough the two state banks. This escalated to a critical situation where the \\nbalance sheets of the two state ban ks are now in a very weak state. Government \\nhas to provide funds to strengthen these banks. Where would we get such funds \\nfrom? The tax revenue levied from the public is used for this purpose.  \\nLoans are obtained from state banks to offset the losses of the state -owned \\nenterprises. Hence, the Government provides funds to the banks when they 5 \\n become weak to prevent them from collapsing. To find such funds, the \\ngovernment will need to increase the tax burden on the people.  \\nSome groups protest demanding a salary increase. Not only the public servants, \\nbut the whole country suffers nowadays. We have to move forward day by day, \\nstep by step toward a recovery from this difficult situation. It’s a tough journey. \\nOn one hand, the strikes deteriorate the country’s way forward. On the other \\nhand, the majority of the people are suffering.  \\nI wish to mention about the salary increments. Salary increments cannot be done \\non an ad -hoc basis. 35 percent of the Government revenue is spent to pay salaries \\nfor the public servants. To increase salaries, the revenue of the government also \\nhas to be increased.  \\nEven without increasing the revenue, salaries can be increased. But how? We \\nhave to print money. Or else, borrow from a foreign country. Or else, impose new \\ntaxes. That is against the “ Samajeewikatha ” principle. Such actions may again drive \\nthe country downwards.  \\nThe Ceylon Electricity Board spends a significant amount on power generation. \\nTherefore, we lifted all legal barriers to add low -cost mega -scale renewable \\nenergy generation to its main grid network. The legislation process is ongoing to \\nrestructure the ine fficient Ceylon Electricity Board, as an efficient institution. \\nUpon implementing the institutional changes to generate power efficiently, the \\ncost of power to the people will be eased.  \\nSome political groups are against restructuring the Ceylon Electricity Board as an \\nefficient institution. They demand to reduce the power tariff at any cost. This will \\nlead us again to be trapped in the same vicious cycle. It is against the \\n“Samajeevikatha ” concept.  \\nThere are criticisms over increasing the government taxes. Why we were \\nsupposed to increase taxes? We neglected to change tax structures and tax \\nrestructuring for ages. This made the fiscal sector weak. To strengthen the fiscal \\nsector structural changes in  the tax system were necessary.  \\nRs. 93 billion  is spent  each month to finance the salary bill of the Government. Rs. \\n70 billion is required  for the Social Welfare Schemes such as Aswesuma , medicine , \\nPensions etc. Meanwhile, Rs. 220 billion is spent to settle loan interest payments. \\nThe public expenditure spent on these requirements is Rs. 383 billion per month. 6 \\n The Government revenue collected within the first 9 months of the year 2023 is \\nRs. 215 billion  per month . The shortage is Rs. 168 billion. To meet this shortage, it \\nis compelled to obtain more loans.  \\nHow was this shortage financed so far? Through foreign loans. Through bank \\noverdrafts. When it is not possible to meet the shortage through these methods, \\nthrough money printing.  \\nUntil the Foreign Debt Restructuring is completed, the foreign financing and \\nloans we can obtain are constrained.  Bank overdrafts amounting to Rs. 900 billion \\nhave been obtained in the year 2021. Currently, the total overdrafts are brought \\nto a lower leve l of Rs . 70 billion. According to the new Central Bank Act, Money \\nPrinting is not allowed. Therefore, if we can’t increase the government revenue \\nby 10 percent to 15 percent we will end up with an economic hell again. If the \\ntaxes are reduced, that gap has  to be filled with something else. This issue cannot \\nbe resolved by simple and sweet promises, as some groups are proposing.  \\nOur revenue target for this year is Rs. 3,415 billion. Out of that, we have collected \\nRs. 2,410 billion so far. This represents that we have failed to generate the targeted \\nrevenue. We have to  also consider these facts  seriously . We have to work hard to \\ncollect the targeted revenue.  \\nWe requested several times from the people who earn higher incomes, to open a \\ntax file. However, the majority of them did not proceed. The main reason is they \\nbelieve that there will be unnecessary troubles if they open a new tax file. Yes, It \\nis true. The re are unnecessary complexities in tax collection. Taxpayers have to \\nobey the unnecessary influences of some officers. There are payment methods \\nthat make the payment of taxes a headache.  \\nLikewise, we have identified several critical issues in our tax system. At present \\nthe burden of taxes is placed only on a few slices of the society. Tax evasion \\nhappens due to the long -lasting weaknesses and negligences of the tax collection \\nsystems.  \\nWe have included several proposals to this Budget to rectify these issues. These \\nproposals cannot be implemented overnight. They should be implemented \\ngradually. We will be able to provide more tax concessions in the future when the \\nGovernment revenue is i ncreased through these proposals.  7 \\n Some people state that the burden of taxes on the people can be reduced by \\nreducing the government Revenue. However, the major portion of the \\ngovernment revenue, around 20  percent is spent on public servant salaries and \\nsocial welfare. The workforce in the public sector is 1.3 million. We cannot remove \\nthem from their jobs even though the number is excessive. If we do so it will lead \\nto a social issue. Therefore, these issu es have to be confronted sensitively and \\ncarefully.  \\nHowever, we have to stop unnecessary expenditure. How much money is wasted \\nat the government institutions? How much time is wasted? We have to avoid \\nthese wastages. How much time, effort, and money are wasted when an ordinary \\ncitizen goes to a government i nstitution for their necessity? We have to rectify \\nthese deficiencies also.  \\nThe public suffers due to the loss -making state -owned enterprises. The loss of \\nthese institutions is borne by the public. The political groups that call them \\nnational treasures are piling up the burden of these loss -making state -owned \\nenterprises and pulli ng the whole nation backward.  \\nMeanwhile, corruption and fraud are spread everywhere over the country like \\ncancer. We have introduced the laws and acts that avoid stealing the wealth of \\nthe nation. There are allegations on some persons claiming that they have stolen \\nthe wealth and resou rces of the Nation.  However, we have to rethink the people \\nwho stole the wealth and resources of the nation as well as the future of the nation.  \\nSeveral political groups stole the future of the nation by nationalizing successful \\nenterprises. Some groups stole the future of the nation by protesting against the \\nleasing out of unutilized properties such as Trincomalee Oil Tanks. Some groups \\nstole the future of the country by protesting against the apparel industry. The \\nfuture was stolen by developing the port. The list is lengthy. Remember. They \\nalso steal.  \\nThe political groups who protested against every development project did not \\nallow the development of the Trincomalee Oil Tank Complex. They wanted to \\nallow the Nuwara Eliya Post Office to crumble down in the same manner they \\nallowed the oil tanks to corro de and crumble down.  \\nAssigning of Nuwara Eliya Post Office for the tourism industry is not an isolated \\nincident. It’s a part of the Nuwara Eliya Development Plan. We are hoping to   \\nestablish a university in Nuwara Eliya There are several massive projects  which  8 \\n are being implemented in Nuwara Eliya. We implement all of these to protect the \\nenvironment as well as  the historical buildings in Nuwara  Eliya.   \\nThey did the same thing for the old post office located inside the Galle Fort. Now \\nthat building has been crumbled down. If we allocated that building for the \\ntourism industry at the right time, we still have that historic landmark building. \\nAnd we earn fo reign exchange.  \\nI would like to quote a recent post on Facebook, posted by Mr. Susantha \\nAriyarathne, an Economic Analyst.  \\n“The formula to protect national treasures is none other than harnessing the \\nmaximum benefit out of them. Not protesting Don’t touch National Treasures. \\nThen these resources will not become a burden to the others ”.  \\nSo far what we have done was hide behind the slogan “Protect National \\nTreasures” and avoid utilizing them. Making them a burden that the country \\ncould hold.  \\nThink. The political and economic concepts that we implemented in our country \\nhave been failed. Please understand that. Make your neighbor understand that.  \\nWe have no journey ahead if we do not construct a fresh political and economic \\nsystem.  \\nThe political and economic system that prevailed in the country has to be \\ncompletely upended. I pointed out this during my previous budget speech. As \\nSugathapala de Silva wrote in his play “Marat/Sade ”, we must have a fresh \\nperspective  like turning a pillow case inside out .  \\nThe social convention  deep -rooted in the country was the Government has to do \\neverything. This is why the Government intermediate in every enterprise by \\nmaking them weak and taking them over. However, it is confirmed that the said \\nsocial convention  is failed and outdated.  \\nWe have to construct our own economic and political system considering past \\nexperiences, global trends, and future challenges. A new social convention has to \\nbe constructed.  \\nThe economy is being healed due to the correct procedures and methodologies \\nwe followed during the past year, building the foundation of this system. The \\nessential commodities are now available in abundance. Interest rates declined 9 \\n from 30 percent p er annum  to 15 percent p er annum . Continuous power supply \\nis ensured. There is no shortage of fertilizer. The primary deficit of the year 2021 \\nwas 5.7 percent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). During the first half of \\n2023 , we were able to achieve a primary surplus. Amid the deep economic crisis, \\nwe were able to increase the tax revenue by 50 percent in the first six months of \\nthe year. The inflation which was sky rocketed up to 70 percent in September \\n2022, declined to 1.5  percent in Oc tober 2023. Foreign reserves increased to USD \\n3.5 billion from near zero  level . The confidence placed in us by foreign countries \\nwas restored. However, we have a long way to go.  \\nWe were able to achieve increasing progress during the past year because of the \\nhonest sacrifices made by the majority of our people. Because of their courage \\nagainst various difficulties. The Government will gradually set the background \\nto ease these diff iculties. We are devoted to providing more facilities and benefits \\nas our economy recovers and our economy stabilizes.  \\nWe cannot put ourselves back in the hell that our country was in 2022. Some \\ngroups are trying day and night to put the country in that place and achieve their \\npolitical targets. We do not have any political target. The only target we have is \\nuplifting the country.  \\nSome people denote this budget as an Election Budget. The reason is the \\nPresidential Election and the General Election is scheduled in the next year. Such \\na Budget is designed to provide unlimited  concessions and salary increments \\naiming at an election victory. This is what happened during the past 75 years since \\nthe independence.   \\nHowever, this Budget is different. This is a Budget that constructs the future of \\nthe country.  A budget which lay s the foundation for a new economic system in  \\nline with current global trends. A prelude to the stable future.  \\nCountry’s v ictory matters to me more than winning the election . This is a budget \\nthat was prepared for the victory of the county. A Budget that was prepared \\naccording to the Buddhist philosophy. Several proposals have been included in \\nthis budget, based on the concept of “ Samajeewikathaa ” concept to ensure victory \\nfor the country and the country’s future.  \\nI will now present the 2024 Budget proposals to this Parliament.   \\n 10 \\n 1. Public sector salaries  \\nGovernment employees have not received a salary increase since 2015. Therefore, \\nI propose to increase public sector salaries without affecting the fiscal balance.  \\nThere are about 1.3 million (1,300,000) public sector employees. Their families \\nhave more than 5 million members. These government employees are currently \\nreceiving a Cost of Living Allowance of Rs. 7,800. We propose to increase their \\nCost of Living Allowa nce to Rs. 17,800  by Rs. 10,000  from January, 2024.  \\nThe General Treasury begins to receive government revenue typically by \\nFebruary and March. Therefore, we can only add this allowance to the monthly \\nsalary from the month of April. We will take steps to pay the balance accumulated \\nfrom January to March in i nstallments within a 6 month period, starting from \\nOctober.  \\n \\n2. Public Pensions  \\nThere are about 730,000 public pensioners. Currently, they are only receiving a \\nCost of Living Allowance of Rs. 3,525 per month. We will increase the monthly \\nCost of Living Allowance of public pensioners to Rs. 6,025  by Rs. 2,500 . This \\nincrease will be implemented from April, 2024. Rs. 386 billion will be spent on \\npublic pensions in 2024.  \\n \\n3. Widows’ & Widowers’ and Orphans’ Pensions (W&OP) scheme  \\nW&OP scheme is a contributory pension scheme in which employees contribute \\n6-7 percent of their basic salary. The Government spends Rs. 65 billion annually \\nfor the payment of the W&OP scheme. The total annual contribution from \\nemployees for W&OP scheme is Rs. 38 billion. Hence, the contribution from the \\npublic employees is not sufficient for the payment of the same. Therefore, I \\npropose to revise the deduction percentage from the salary for this pension \\ncontribution to 8 percent for all service categories f rom April 2024 onward. With \\nthis adjustment, an additional Rs. 9 billion can be collected annually, and it will \\nensure the continuity of the pension scheme for widows, widowers and orphans.   \\n \\n \\n \\n 11 \\n 4. Food and lodging allowances  \\nThe allowance provided to police officers who travel long distances to attend \\nduties does not match with the current situation. Hence, instead of the allowance \\nthat is paid at present, I propose to pay a food and lodging allowance with \\nappropriate adjustment for three groups of officers in the Police Department.  \\n \\n5. Distress Loans  \\nDue to the economic hardships that prevailed in the country, several measures \\nwere taken to carefully manage public expenditure. In that process, the \\nentitlement of Public Servants for the Distress Loan given during unexpected and \\nunprepared hardships face d by them was subjected to some limitations. Hence, I \\npropose to provide the Distress loan facility for all the public servants effective \\nfrom January 01, 2024 as previously done.  \\n \\n6. Aswesuma programme  \\nWe started providing Aswesuma  benefits with the support of development \\npartners including the World Bank. However, in the next year we will provide \\nbenefits to the people from our own funds.  In the previous years, we have spent \\nRs. 60 billion for this programme. Now, it has been increased to Rs. 183 billion. In \\nthe year 2024, it is expected to spend three times the amount spent on the social \\nsecurity programs in the previous years for the Aswesuma program me. This will \\nprovide relief for 2 million families.  \\nAswesuma  programme is based on objective  selection criteria. The delays in \\nimplementation when transitioning in to the new programme is being addressed. \\nA programme is implemented to provide justice to families who face injustice. \\nRetro spective  payments will be made to eligible recipients who faced payment \\ndelays.  \\nWe will use the knowledge and experience of Samurdhi officers to empower \\nbeneficiaries of the Aswesuma  programme.  \\nAbout 1 30,000 persons with disabilities and kidney patients are paid a monthly \\nallowance of Rs. 5,000. I propose to increase the payment up to Rs. 7,500. It is a 50 \\npercent increase. The present monthly payment of Rs. 2,000 for elderly citizens \\nwill also be increa sed to Rs. 3,000. Around 530,000 persons will benefit from this.  12 \\n The beneficiaries who were on the waiting list and are already receiving financial \\nassistance will be entered into the list of beneficiaries from 2024. For this purpose, \\na total of Rs. 138 billion will be allocated.  \\nSome families may face sudden calamities. The breadwinner of the family may \\ndie or meet with an accident. Or he may lose his job. In such situations, the whole \\nfamily becomes helpless. Such families need to wait for a long time to get \\nAswesuma relief accor ding to the current system. However, in future, we will \\nreview the Aswesuma  beneficiaries once in every 6 months. This will allow new \\nfamilies to be added to the beneficiary list without a delay.  \\nI will increase the allocation for cash transfers provided through Aswesuma  and \\nallowances provided to persons with disabilities, kidney patients and the Elderly \\nto Rs. 205 billion in next year.  \\nWe have identified many shortcomings and weaknesses in the system of \\nproviding a monthly allowance of Rs. 4,500 to pregnant mothers. Rs. 10 billion \\nhas been  allocated to resolve such issues and make this program more systematic.  \\n \\n7. Small & Medium Enterprises (SMEs)  \\nSMEs have been badly affected by the economic crisis and COVID -19 pandemic. \\nA recent survey revealed that about 20 percent of such enterprises have either \\ntemporarily or permanently closed down. The survey also revealed a decrease in \\nthe performance volume  of the currently operating enterprises. We want to fast \\ntrack the journey towards a production economy. Therefore, SMEs should be \\nfurther strengthened, encouraged and facilitated. For this purpose, we are \\nintroducing a concessionary loan scheme of around Rs. 30 billion with the support \\nof the Asian Development Bank.  \\nThis programme is the first phase of action which will collectively provide a major \\nimpetus to the SMEs. In addition to concessionary credit facilities, capacity \\ndevelopment programs are implemented for the participating institutions. Steps \\nwill be taken t o link SMEs with the value chains of large companies in the \\nindustrial sector. The required provisions have already been included in the \\nBudget 2024.  \\nAccordingly, the total amount allocated for the development of SMEs is Rs. 50 \\nbillion. As a result, a financial space worth around Rs. 250 billion is created.  \\n \\n 13 \\n 8. “Urumaya ” Programme  \\nWaste Land Ordinance was passed in 1897. The British government acquired \\nthousands of acres of rural land across the country under that Ordinance. \\nAfterwards, in 1935, under the Land Development Ordinance, those land slots \\nwere distributed among farmers un der the license system. But although around \\nhundred years have passed, the ownership of these farmlands has not been \\nhanded back to the farmers who own them. As mentioned in the drama “Chalk \\nCircle”, “farmers with good conduct; should win the land and vill ages” We are \\nhanding over the lands to farmers who lost the ownership of their traditional \\nlands during the British colonial era.  We expect to commence this task in 2024 and \\ncomplete it within another few years. Two million  (2,000,000) families will get the \\nownership of land and farmland. I allocate Rs. 2 billion for this purpose.  \\n \\n9. Urban Home Ownership  \\nHouses constructed under various urban development programmes have been \\nrented to low -income families. A monthly rent of around Rs. 3,000 is obtained \\nfrom those families. I will completely stop collecting rent from these families. Not \\nonly that, the full o wnership of these houses will be given to those families. In \\n2024, nearly 50,000 families will be given the ownership of these houses.  \\nBy the completion of the programme of providing land and housing rights to the \\npeople, about 70 percent of the people of this country will become the owners of \\nland and houses.  \\n \\n10. Estate Housing  \\nEstate dwellers are not owners of lands. We will take steps to grant land \\nownership and build houses for them. As the initial step, I expect to allocate Rs. \\n4 billion.  \\n \\n11. Bimsaviya Programme  \\nUnder the Bimsaviya Programme which commenced in 1998, one million land \\nplots have been covered out of the total number of land plots of 12 million. In \\norder to provide the necessary facilities to expeditiously complete this \\nprogramme, I allocate Rs. 600 million.  \\n 14 \\n 12. Decentralized Budget  \\nDue to the difficult situation in the country and the lack of funds under the \\ndecentralized budget programme in the past, regional development programmes \\ncould not be implemented. As these programmes were temporarily suspended, \\npublic representatives could  not contribute to the rural development activities. \\nWe will recommence the decentralized budget programme. I will provide Rs. \\n11,250 million through the district coordination committees for this purpose. This \\nprogramme will be implemented under the superv ision of the Department of \\nNational Planning using a methodical and standard approach.  \\n \\n13. “Kandu kara  Dhashakaya ”  \\nThe public infrastructure and services available in the hill country are relatively \\nunderdeveloped due to disparities in the distribution of resources for various \\nreasons. This disparity is also reflected in the living standards of the people. The \\ngovernme nt has recognized the importance of giving priority to rural \\ndevelopment in the hill country. A 10 -year multipurpose rural and community \\ndevelopment program from the year 2024 including all the 89 Divisional \\nSecretariat divisions that belong to the hill co untry areas of Sabaragamuwa and \\nCentral Provinces as well as Badulla, Galle, Matara,  Kalutara  and Kurunegala \\ndistricts. I propose to allocate Rs. 10 billion for the year 2024 for this purpose.  \\n \\n14. Approving development project proposals  \\nWe have already introduced  a new mechanism to approve development projects. \\nA Government Committee has been  established to review new projects. As per \\nrecommendations of the Committee, the Minister of Finance will grant approval \\nfor projects. Government will not allocate funds for projects that deviate from this \\nprocedure.  \\nThis will enable to allocate capital expenditure to give a higher contribution to \\nthe economic growth. This is very important for fiscal and debt sustainability. To \\nachieve this objective, I will increase the capital expenditure to Rs. 1,260 billion  in \\n2024 . This is equal to 4 percent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP).  \\nThe implementation of number of projections have been temporarily suspend ed \\ndue to the economic crisis. I will allocate another Rs. 55 billion to recommence 15 \\n and complete these projects and to provide necessary provisions for the capital \\nexpenditure proposals mentioned in this Budget Speech.  \\nWe will allocate this by transferring Rs. 55 billion from the Vote  of the National \\nBudget Department  to Capital Expenditure Vote. Thus, we would allocate Rs. \\n1,260 billion for the development activities of next year.  \\nFurther, a number of projects that was implemented under foreign loans and \\ngrants have been temporarily suspended. We will have the opportunity to \\nrecommence these projects after the completion of foreign debt restructuring \\nactivities.  \\nIt is observed that the project management committees have been unable to \\nachieve expected objectives of the development projects. Hence, I propose to \\nestablish a unit for this purpose under each Ministry from 2024 onwards, to \\ninclude project related activities to the duty list of the permanent staff and to \\nprocure human resources under contract and duty bas is only when related \\nspecialists are not available in the public sector.  \\n \\n15. Rural Roads  \\nSince the last few years, it has not been possible to carry out the maintenance and \\nmanagement of rural roads properly, I propose to allocate Rs.  10 billion for the \\nrenovation of such roads which have become dilapidated.  \\n \\n16. Natural Disasters  \\nWe had to face adverse weather conditions during the last few months. Roads \\nand bridges were damaged due to floods and landslides. I allocate Rs. 2,000 \\nmillion to rehabilitate damaged rural roads.  \\n \\n17. Drinking water  \\nThere are issues with regard to drinking water in all provinces of the country. We \\nwill prioritize  drinking water projects when allocating the decentralized budget \\nand obtaining foreign loans.  16 \\n Education  \\nThe future of a country can be enriched by introducing an education system that \\nis suitable for this era. Our country has an outdated education system. It is an  \\neducation system that produces memorizers. Creative people are not generat ed \\nunder this system. Also, the benefits of free education are not fully available to \\nthe people.  \\nTherefore, we are implementing a series of comprehensive education reforms. We \\nappointed a group of 25 experts to prepare this new national education policy \\nframework. Those proposals were further polished through the direction of a \\nCabinet Committee headed by me. This policy framework has now been adopted \\nby the Cabinet.  \\nI would like to inform this House about several key institutions that will be \\nestablished under these reforms. These are the Higher National Council on \\nEducation, National Higher Education Commission, and the National Skills \\nCommission.  The detailed information in this regard will be informed to this \\nHouse by the Minister of Education in the next two weeks.  \\nRecently, this post written by Ajana Ranagala on Facebook has taken my \\nattention.   \\n\"My child is suffering not just for days, weeks, months, but for years due to his \\ndecision to do A/Ls in the national curriculum as he wanted to gain admission to \\na local university.  His friends who studied the international stream are going \\nabroad for higher education \" \\nThis is the real situation. Hence, we will provide the opportunity to obtain higher \\neducation without delay to every child who passes A/Ls.  \\n \\n18. Expansion of Science and Technology Education in Universities   \\nWe will take steps to establish four new universities considering the current \\ntrends for the technical sector.   \\n(a) Seethawaka Science and Technology University (Lalith \\nAthulathmudali Post Graduate Institute will be incorporated to \\nthis University)  17 \\n (b) Kurunegala Technology University under the Kothalawala \\nDefence University.  \\n(c) Management and Technology University  \\n(d) International University of Climate Change  \\n \\nAlso, I propose that the rules and regulations should be adopted to convert the \\nfollowing private higher education institutions that are currently in operation \\ninto universities.  \\n(a) NSBM  \\n(b) Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology (SLIIT)  \\n(c) Horizon  Campus  \\n(d) Royal Institute  \\nAs per the 13th Amendment, provincial councils have been empowered to \\nestablish universities. We expect that provincial councils will also establish \\nuniversities in the future.  \\n \\n19. National Education University  \\nI propose to establish an Education University focused on education by \\nintegrating 19 Colleges of Education. Bachelor of Educational Degree s will be \\noffered  to students who complete a four -year programme under an existing \\nCollege of Education  in accordance with the relevant standards. This programme \\nwill be implemented step by step and I propose to make a Rs. 1 billion budgetary \\nprovision for the year 2024 for this programme.   \\n \\n20. New Technology University  \\nA new Technology University will be established in Kandy under the guidance \\nof IIT University in Chennai, India. India will fully support us in this endeavour.  \\n \\n \\n 18 \\n 21. State  Universities  \\nA program me to enhance  State  Universities to suit the modern  era will be \\nimplemented . This program will be commenced at Peradeniya University.  \\nRs. 500 million will be allocated for the initial development activities of this \\nprogram me aimed at the centenary  celebrations  of Peradeniya University in 2042.  \\nDepartment of Allergy and Immunology, University of Sri Jayawardenepura will \\nbe upgraded as the National Institute of Allergy and Immunology. For this \\npurpose, Rs. 40 million will be allocated for the next year  as per the  work plan to \\ndevelop laboratories and other required facilities  \\nAfter that, our focus will be shifted to  the Universities of Colombo, Kelaniya and \\nMoratuwa. I request the se universities  to prepare and submit a formal plan  for \\nthis purpose.  \\n \\n22. Non -State  Universities  \\n \\nWe will allow any recognized educational institution in the world to establish \\nuniversities in Sri Lanka  once  a set of powerful rules and regulations for the \\nregulation of non -state universities  are put in place . This will create opportunities \\nfor every student who passes G.C.E (Advanced Level) to obtain  university \\neducation and earn foreign exchange through  the admission of  foreign students . \\nLoan facilities will be provided to students studying in these non -state \\nuniversities. In addition to the existing interest -free student loan scheme, I \\npropose to implement a subsidized student loan scheme through commercial \\nbanks. Arrangements will be made to repay the loan after getting a job.  \\n \\n \\n23. National Higher Education Commission.  \\nA National Higher Education Commission will be established to integrate the \\nUniversity Grants Commission (UGC) and Tertiary and Vocational Education \\nCommission (TVEC). This Commission will be granted decision -making and \\nregulatory powers for strengthening and expanding higher education.  \\n  19 \\n 24. National Skills Commission    \\nA National Skills Commission will be established which is suitable for the \\nprevailing challenges. Under this Commission, Vocational Training Authority, \\nNational Apprenticeship and Industrial Training Authority will be integrated.  \\n \\n25. Vocational Education for Provincial Councils  \\nI propose to hand over the vocational education institutions that are currently \\noperating under the central government to the nine Provincial Councils. \\nProvincial Boards of Vocational Education will be established to develop and \\nmodernize the skills develo pment sector. In the future, only the necessary \\nguidance will be provided by the central government to regulate vocational \\neducation activities, while all education and training functions and services will \\nbe implemented through the provincial councils.     \\nAs such, the necessary arrangements will be made to establish a Fund to enhance \\ntechnical vocational skills. Discussions have already commenced with the Asian \\nDevelopment Bank for this purpose. In addition to the allocation made to these \\ninstitutions alrea dy, Rs. 450 million is allocated for the coming year for these \\ninstitutions.  \\n \\n26. Training in Information Technology  \\nA training program will be  launched for job -seeking graduates in association with \\nprivate institutions related to information technology. These graduates are given \\ntraining and work experience for a minimum period of 6 months. I allocate Rs. \\n750 million for this purpose.  \\nSuchtraining program mes will be implemented to other skill shortage areas such \\nas construction , care giving  and tourism services.  \\n \\n27. Youth and Adult Education  \\nThe youth who are not eligible  for university education should be given \\nopportunities to obtain  local and foreign jobs. Also, it is needed to create \\nopportunities for adults working in the publi c and private sectors  to obtain new \\nknowledge. I propose to allocate Rs. 150 million to the Sri Lanka Foundation for \\nthe necessary technical and physical modernization projects for conducting \\ntraining courses  and to deliver services.  20 \\n 28. English for all  \\nIt is necessary to develop a national program me to enhance  English literacy in Sri \\nLanka. The aim of this program me is to provide English literacy to all by 2034. I \\nallocate Rs. 500 million to start this ten -year programme.  \\n \\n29. Suraksha  \\nI propose to reintroduce the Suraksha Student’s Insurance Scheme, which was \\nintroduced in the year 2016 but is  currently not in operation. Accordingly, all \\nschool students will be entitled to this insurance coverage.  \\n \\n \\nHealth services  \\n \\nWe are committed to maintaining the quality of health services. We  will take \\nactions to identify deficiencies, weaknesses and crises and take measures for the \\nadvancement of the field.  \\n \\n30. Drug Procurement Guidelines  \\nOur focus has been on issuing specific guidelines for the procurement of \\nmedicines and setting up a separate institution for that purpose. We are taking \\nthis step after conducting a detailed study of the government\\'s medicines \\nprocurement process.  \\n \\n31. Medical and Health Research  \\n \\nI expect to increase the investment in medical and health research to bring Sri \\nLanka’s medical research output on par with the rest of the world.  Rs. 75 million \\nwill be allocated for the first phase of t he strengthening of the infrastructure and \\nlaboratory facilities of the Medical Research Institute.  \\nI propose  to allocate  Rs. 25 million  for the next year under a three -year plan to \\nupgrade the facilities of the National Drugs Quality Assurance Laboratory.  \\n \\n 21 \\n 32. A cardiopulmonary resuscitation unit for Badulla  \\nThere is no cardiopulmonary resuscitation facility in any hospital in Uva \\nprovince. We are filling this gap. I allocate  Rs. 300 million for the establishment \\nof a resuscitation unit at the Badulla Teaching Hospital and for the purchase of \\nnecessary equipment.  \\n \\n \\n33.   Promotions for Medical Officers  \\nI propose to expedite the arrangements to adopt a  promotion scheme that is \\napplicable to both specialists  and graded doctors.  \\n \\n34. Postgraduate opportunities  \\nWith the aim of upgrading the careers  of medical doctors,  we proposed to expand \\nthe postgraduate opportunities available for doctors under 2023 Budget. In \\naddition to the universities in which the programme is currently implemented, \\nUniversities of Kelaniya, Jayewardenepura, and Rajarata University will also be \\nincluded to the programme .  \\n \\nIndigenous medicine  \\nWe will take action to strengthen and popularize Indigenous medicine.  \\n \\n35. Sri Lankan Wellness  \\nThere is an international demand for indigenous medicines, food supplements, \\nmedicinal cosmetics and herbal ingredients made from traditional medicinal \\nrecipes. If we use this opportunity properly, we will be able to further expand the \\ninternational market. I propose to provide necessary facilities for such \\ninvestments under the supervision of the Indigenous Medicine Section of the \\nMinistry of Health and the Ayurvedic Drug Corporation.  \\nIn order to provide local and Ayurvedic wellness to tourists, a plan will be  \\nlaunched to establish wellness centers in tourist hotels and resorts in accordance \\nunder  the concept of “ Sri Lankan Wellness ”. Rs. 100 million will be allocated for \\nthis purpose.  22 \\n Modernization of agriculture and fisheries industries  \\nAgriculture needs to be uplifted to a competitive level  under a new economy . \\nValue added agri products need to be produced. Agriculture needs to be \\nmodernized focusing on exports.  \\nProvisions will be made by this budget  for agricultural modernization projects, \\nsmallholder agribusiness partnership initiatives , and crop diversification.  \\nFurther, work plans will be launched to uplift and nurture the fishing industry  \\nand to utilize new technology and knowledge for fisheries industry.  \\n \\n36. Agricultural and Fisheries Modernization Boards  \\nI will establish provincial agricultural and fisheries modernization boards to \\nassist in development of agricultural and fisheries sectors. All Agrarian Service \\nCenters will be upgraded as Agriculture Modernization Centers. For this \\npurpose, a joint program me consisting of the government, private sector, farmers \\nand agronomists will be implemented from the 2023/24  Maha  season . For these \\nactivities, I propose to allocate Rs. 2,500 million.  \\nThe purpose of this is to increase the paddy production from 3.5 metric tonnes to \\n8 metric tonnes per hectare. This would give us the opportunity to utilize the \\nuncultivated paddy fields to other useful cultivation activities while improving \\nthe productivi ty of the paddy production of the dry sector.  \\nThe productivity of paddy cultivation in muddy lands in wet zone is very low. \\nThe law does not permit to grow any other crop instead of paddy cultivation. I \\npropose to remove legal impediments to grow other crops in such bare \\nuncultivated land.  \\nIn addition, I propose to allocate 300,000 acres from other government lands \\nincluding State Plantation Corporation,  Mahaweli A and B Zones , and Land \\nReform Commission for large scale agriculture activities.  \\n \\n37. Fisheries Sector  \\nIncreasing the productivity of the fisheries sector is the most sustainable way to \\nimprove fishermen’s livelihoods and incomes. For this purpose, the government 23 \\n is starting to cooperate with the private sector in the management of fishing ports. \\nIn this way, the necessary infrastructure including warehouses can be developed \\nto reduce wastage and optimize productivity.  \\nAbout 35 percent of the country\\'s total fish harvest comes from the North Sea. To \\nimprove the facilities necessary for those functions, Rs. 500 million will be \\nallocated.  \\n29 percent of Sri Lanka\\'s total fish harvest comes from the freshwater fisheries \\nand aquaculture sector. There are about 12,000 permanent and temporary \\nreservoirs in Sri Lanka. The total size of the reservoir is about 260,000 hectares. \\nFor the development of the freshwater fishing industry, I allocate Rs. 200 million. \\nTo maintain the sustainability of this program me in the future, I further propose \\nto prepar e a program me to encourage the fishing community by establishing a \\nrevolving fund through community participation.  \\n \\n38. Rehabilitation of small tanks  \\nSmall tanks play a crucial role in irrigation and agriculture in the country. This \\nbecomes more important with the effects of climate change. I propose to assign \\nthe responsibilities of rehabilitating small tanks to the farmer organizations of the \\nrespecti ve areas. We will provide the necessary authority and support to the \\nfarmer organizations. Then they can work together with the private sector to \\nrehabilitate small tanks. Our aim is to increase agricultural production through \\nthese measures.  \\n \\n39. Dairy Products  \\nThe majority of dairy farmers are currently engaged in the industry as a means of \\nlivelihood. However, we need to raise it to the status of a profitable industry and \\ncreate the necessary background for dairy farmers to earn high income. Towards \\nthis, it is  important to increase capital investment and establish profitable \\nmedium -scale milk production units. For this purpose, I propose to implement a \\nre-finance loan scheme to meet the financial needs of those engaged in the dairy \\nvalue chain.  24 \\n A special program me will be implemented to increase milk production by 53  \\npercent  in 5 years with the contribution of the private sector by effectively using \\nall the farms owned by the National Livestock Development Board.  When this \\nproject is completed, the daily milk production will increase to 20 million liters \\nper day. That\\'s a five -fold increase.  \\nAmbewela farm has obtained successful results under this programme. The daily \\ndairy production which was 1,600 litres in Ambewela farm, has now increased to \\n50,000 litres of milk. It is our aim to increase this up to 75,000 litres of milk.  \\n \\n40. Support for the construction sector  \\nThe construction sector can be identified as one of the most depressed sectors in \\nthe recent past. Due to various reasons like COVID -19 pandemic, economic crisis, \\nimport restrictions, etc., the construction sector underwent  a huge crisis. \\nConsidering this situation, we expect to conduct a new experiment to support \\nthem.  \\nGovernment agencies will provide free lands. We will allow construction \\ncompanies to construct buildings on those lands according to the plans of the \\nrespective government agencies. After construction, these institutions will pay \\nmonthly rent to the construction company. Upon recovering the construction cost  \\nand receiving corresponding dividends, the full ownership of the building will \\nbe handed over to the government agency. The construction of the new building \\ncomplex of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs wi ll be implemented as the first pilot \\nproject.  \\nWe hope to implement a new program me aimed at uplifting the living conditions \\nof the people living in urban estate housing  in Colombo and the developing  of \\nthe construction sector. We will give the construction industry the responsibility \\nof building large houses and shopping malls in urban estates  in Colombo city. We  \\nwill give those lands to them for free. The only condition they  will have to fulfill \\nis to provide new houses to the people residing in that estate. If th ese families ask \\nfor houses in that housing complex, they should be given a house in these  urban \\nestates . If th ese families ask for houses in another place, the construction company \\nshould fulfill that request.  \\n 25 \\n 41. National branding of Sri Lanka  \\nSri Lanka has many untapped potentials to emerge as a strong country. To \\ncapitalize on these potentials, it is essential to implement national branding \\nefforts by re -engaging with government agencies, businesses, citizens, cultural \\ninstitutions and interna tional organizations to realign Sri Lanka\\'s direction and \\nreclaim the country\\'s status as a top tourist destination and attractive investment \\nhub. I allocate Rs.  100 million  for this purpose . \\n \\n42. Logistics  \\nThere is enormous economic value in leveraging Sri Lanka\\'s strategic location and \\npositioning the country as a supply hub. However, many steps have to be taken \\nto realize this long -term dream. As the first step, the government will work \\ntogether with all s takeholders to develop and implement a national supply policy.  \\nWe expect to initiate land connectivity between Sri Lanka and India. We expect \\nto utilize Colombo Port to meet the supply needs of South West India and \\nTrincomalee Port to meet the supply needs of South East India.  \\nThe capacity of the Colombo Port will improve after the construction of the West \\nTerminal and the expected Colombo North Port after the year 2030. Trincomalee \\nport will also be developed. This will enable Sri Lanka to harness the benefits of \\nrapid growth a nd industrialization in the South Indian region. Our ultimate goal \\nis to elevate Sri Lanka as a regional logistics hub.  \\n \\n43. Women Empowerment  \\nI propose to introduce gender -based budgeting and make related legislation. We \\nare also working to introduce laws for the empowerment of women.  \\n \\n44. Handloom   \\nI propose to allocate Rs. 300 million to implement a special program me for \\neconomic empowerment of women and youth engaged in the handloom \\nindustry.  26 \\n 45. Housing for internally displaced people  \\nAlthough 14 years have passed since the end of internal conflict in the North and \\nEastern provinces, some families are still homeless in those areas. Rs. 2,000 million \\nhas been allocated from this year’s Budget to meet the needs of resettling these \\npeople.  However, I propose to allocate Rs. 500 Mn as an additional provision  to \\nspeed up the housing program me and provide essential relief to the families  \\nremain  homeless.  \\n \\n46. Compensations for Missing Persons  \\nCompensations have been provided to 181 missing persons and victims affected \\nby the internal conflict in the Northern and Eastern Provinces. Compensations \\nwill be provided to another 170 by the end of 2023. Preliminary work has been \\ncompleted for more than 6,300 incidents out of the submitted requests, and Rs . \\n1,500 million has already been allocated by the Appropriation Act. To expedite \\nthe payment of these compensations, I propose to allocate Rs. 1,000 million.  \\n \\n47. Water Issue in Jaffna  \\nThere are serious issues regarding  drinking water in Jaffna. Even after many \\nyears, this problem is still not solved. The pre -feasibility study to provide a \\nsolution to this complex water problem has now been completed. Accordingly, \\nthe best solution for us is to implement the Pali-Aru Water Project. I expect to \\ncommence the initial work of this project in the first half of 2024. Rs. 250 million \\nwill be granted for the year 2024 for the preliminary activities of this program me. \\n \\n48. Punarin City Development  \\nPunareen is a very important town for tourism, located near the Sangupiddy \\nBridge on the Jaffna - Mannar main road. We will provide Rs. 500 million for the \\ndevelopment of Punareen City.  \\n \\n 27 \\n 49. Galle District Auditorium  \\nThe construction of the Gall e District Auditorium  which started in 2019 has been \\nhalted  midway  due to  the recent crisis. A considerable amount of money has been \\ninvested so far  on this  and a public -private partnership is required to take this \\nproject forward. Therefore, Rs. 500 million will be allocated as its’ government \\ncontribution.  \\n \\n50. Bandarawela Economic Centre  \\nI propose to establish an Economic Center in Bandarawela and provide  necessary \\ninfrastructure as a project with equal economic contribution by the  Bandarawela \\nMunicipal Council and the Government. We will allocate Rs. 250 million as the \\ngovernment contribution for this purpose.  \\n \\n51. Lower Malwathu  Oya Project  \\nIn addition to the budgetary provision which has already been made, I propose \\nthat  Rs. 2 ,500 million to be allocated to this project in order to expedite the rest of \\nthe work of this project.  \\n \\nCulture  \\nOur culture has been subject to limitations for years. Most people think that \\nculture is only about holding state award ceremonies. There are hardly any \\nformal procedures in place to nurture  the nation\\'s culture and pass on its \\nhistorical legacy to future generations. Despite various difficulties and challenges, \\nwe will implement a number of cultural projects through this budget.  \\n \\n52. Maha Vihara University  \\nAnuradhapura Maha Vihara languished for centuries without much attention \\nuntil the latter half of the 19th Century. A major role was played by the Maha \\nVihara in preserving and maintaining Theravada Buddhism as well as \\npropagating  Buddhism in the World. Considering these facts, I propose to 28 \\n establish  Maha Vihara University incorporating all the aspects of Mahavihara’s \\nhistory and roles.  It is expected to complete the initial work on this during the \\nnext decade. A Performance Committee will be appointed under the Presidential \\nSecretariat in order to commence the work within a six -month period. Rs.  400 \\nmillion will be allocated for the initial works of this programme.  \\n \\n53. International Buddhist Library in Anuradhapura  \\nAs a complementary work to the establishment of the Maha Vihara University, I \\npropose to establish a  modern  international library in Anuradhapura. The \\nobjective of this library is securing archaic  documents  from international \\nBuddhist countries and provide facilities to scholars who want to use them for \\ntheir research purposes . It is expected to implement this programme within the \\n3-year time frame and Rs. 100 million will be allocated for the next year.  \\n \\n54. Buddhist Culture  Museum  in Kandy  \\nFocusing on  the Buddhist civilization of Sri Lanka , I expect to establish a Sri \\nLankan Buddhist Museum for research activities as well as for cultural promotion \\nactivities. There are s uch Museums in different countries related  to different \\ncivilizations. They are u tilized  for research and tourist attraction. Rs. 200 million \\nwill be allocated in the next year to establish the  museum, which is expected to \\nbe built in several phases.  \\nOur ambition is to make Sri Lanka a Buddhist tourist center through these \\nactivities.  \\n \\n55. Development of Cricket  \\nWe know that cricket in Sri Lanka is currently facing an institutional crisis and a \\nshortage of talent. Rs. 1.5 billion will be allocated from this budget for the \\ndevelopment of school cricket and for providing necessary facilities to cricket \\nplayers at th e provincial level. Schools and provinces with less facilities are given \\npriority in providing this allocation.  \\n 29 \\n 56. Transport Sector  \\nThe Department of Motor Traffic will be digitized in 2024.  \\nA pilot project of running 200 electric buses will be  started jointly with the Sri \\nLanka Transport Board in the Western Province.  \\nThe Kandy multi transport center project will be started in January under the loan \\nsupport of the World Bank to remove the vehicle  and passenger traffic in the \\nhistoric city of Kandy and integrate  train, bus and other taxi  services . Rs. 1.5 \\nbillion will be allocated for the development of the access roads of this center.  \\nThe Department of Railway will complete  the renovation of the railway track \\nfrom Anuradhapura to Mihintala in January 2024  and I allocate Rs. 200 million to \\nsetup a large city base on the station premises of Mihintal e with transport, \\neconomic, container and storage facilities with the financial assistance of the \\nprivate sector.  \\nWe also hope to call for proposals from local and foreign investors  to establish  \\nStation Plaza or Railway Station Towns  as mixed development projects on the \\nbasis of  Public Private Partnership focusing  on railway stations in metropolitan \\nareas such as Pe ttah, Galle, Matara, Anuradhapura, Jaffna and tourist \\ndestinations.  \\n \\n57. Public service Delivery  \\nOur focus should be on both responsibility and accountability in providing public \\nservices. It is essential to maintain strict financial discipline while implementing \\nthe Government budget.  \\n \\n58. Responsibility on matters relating to the budget  \\nI propose  to consider Provincial Councils as special spending units for budgetary \\npurposes. Accordingly, the Chief Secretaries of Provincial Councils should act as \\nthe Chief Accounting Officers as practiced by Secretaries to  other line ministr ies. \\nThe Provincial Council is responsible to the Parliament for the  money  spent for \\nbudget purposes.  30 \\n When preparing the budget based on the Sustainable Development Goals, the \\nnecessary guidelines have been issued to fulfill the above goals to all ministries, \\ndepartments and institutions, and they should act in accordance with those \\nguidelines.  \\n \\n59. Provincial Revenue   \\nI propose  that the revenue collected from the provincial councils should not be \\nlimited to cover recurrent expenses but should also be used as capital expenditure \\nfor the development of the province. However, in order to avoid the practical \\ndifficulties of sudden c hang e in the ongoing process, I propose to use 50 percent \\nof the provincial council income f rom the year 202 5 as recurrent expenses and to \\nuse the additional income  as capital expenditure.  \\n \\n60. Promotion of export industries by Provincial Councils  \\nUnder the Industrial Promotion Act No. 46 of 1990, the powers of the provincial  \\ncouncils  regarding industries have been limited. They have no powers to permit \\nexport industries. They can only permit  factories with a capital investment of less  \\nthan   Rs. 4 million and less than 50 permanent employees. We will cancel these \\nprovisions. The annual turnover limit will be increased to Rs. 600 million. This \\nenables the provincial councils to promote export -oriented industries. We are also \\ntaking steps to establ ish an industrial service center in every province.  \\n \\n61. Encouraging the Self -Financing of Local Government Authorities   \\nAlthough the local government bodies have been empowered to collect revenue \\nand manage the necessary activities for the well -being of the local people, the \\ngovernment bears the expenses for the salaries and other development works of \\nthose entities.  \\nGiven the existing financial constraints, Local Government Authorities (LGAs) \\nshould be encouraged to provide their services efficiently under a self -financing \\nmodel. As a first step, we are taking actions to  provide only 80 percent  of \\nfinancing for the payment of salaries to Municipal Councils  effective  from \\n01.01.2024 . This financing will  be further  reduce d effective from 01.01.2025 . I also 31 \\n propose Local Government Authorities to  gradually encourage self -financing \\nwithin the next 5 years.   \\n \\n62. National Janasabha  \\nUnder the Janasabha system, it is expected to implement the process of resource \\nallocation at the national level by identifying the unsolved development needs at \\nthe rural level and giving priority to them, with the coordination of the public \\nrepresentativ es representing the respective areas. This will provide an \\nopportunity for the people of the village to collectively decide their development \\npriorities, allocate resources, and submit those development priorities directly to \\nthe government, regardless of party, race, and religion. Also, everyone from \\npublic representatives to ordinary  villagers can contribute to this program. \\nEspecially the young people of the village have the opportunity to directly \\ncontribute to this. I propose to allocate Rs. 700 million to establish the National \\nJanasabha Secretariat to coordinate these activities.  \\n \\n63. Hingurakgoda International Airport  \\nAlthough there have been discussions on various scales for some time, the \\nconstruction of the Hingurakgoda International Airport has not been \\nimplemented. Therefore, for its basic activities Rs.  2 billion will be allocated for \\n2024.  \\n \\n64. Central Expressway  \\nAs soon as the foreign debt restructuring process is completed, the second phase \\nof the Central Expressway, i.e. the section from Kadawatha to Mirigama, will be \\nstarted jointly with China. We hope to get the support of Japan for the \\nconstruction of the sec tion from Kurunegala to Galagedara. We are planning to \\nfind out whether it is possible to build the highway up to Katugastota.  \\n \\n \\n 32 \\n 65. Program for Youth Development  \\nMany programs are implemented by various ministries and government agencies \\nfocusing on the development of the youth. But an integrated youth development \\nprogram should be implemented by coordinating all these programs and it \\nshould include new programs th at suit the new economic and social conditions. \\nIt is proposed to implement this joint youth development program by the \\nPresident\\'s Office and allocate a provision of Rs. 1 billion for this purpose . \\n \\n66. Gem Industry  \\nSri Lanka\\'s gem industry has not yet reached full capacity and no generally \\nagreed program has been implemented. A common program should be prepared \\nfor the development of gemstones from foreign countries and considering the \\nexisting problems in the gem in dustry in this country. In the medium term, the \\ngovernment, the private sector and all relevant parties should implement the \\nprogram together. A framework plan for that is proposed to be prepared and \\nimplemented in the next 3 months.  \\n \\n67. Trincomalee suburban development  \\nThe government\\'s desire is to develop Trincomalee as a major economic center of \\nthe country. Especially, various development activities related to the port can \\ncontribute greatly to the development of the country. This is a long -term \\ndevelopment program. I t also includes large -scale agricultural programs and a \\ncoastal tourism zone. It is proposed to launch this development program me \\ntogether with Indian investors and to establish a presidential task force for these \\nactivities.  \\n \\n68. Flood Control in Galle District  \\nThe Gin Ganga water management program should be implemented as a \\nmeasure to prevent floods in Galle district. It is our expectation to implement this \\nas a medium -term programme. I propose to allocate Rs. 250 million for its basic \\nwork.  \\n 33 \\n 69. Restructuring of debt  \\nDue to the space created by the debt restructuring process, the government was \\nable to find resources for relief measures. Under the debt restructuring supported \\nby the International Monetary Fund, Sri Lanka\\'s public debt as a percentage of \\nGDP is expected  to be reduced from 128 percent in 2022 to 95 percent in 2032. \\nPeople  will get the benefits of these savings. After the completion of the debt \\nrestructuring process, the overall macroeconomic stability and stability of the \\nfinancial sector will be further strengthened. We have now been able to achieve \\nsignificant progress in the debt restructuring process. Key aspects of Domestic \\nDebt Optimization are completed.  \\nAs part of the restructuring of International Sovereign Bonds under the External \\nDebt Restructuring Process, Sri Lanka\\'s net debt is reduced to its present value. \\nUSD denominated New financial instruments should be issued to settle existing \\ninternational sovereign bonds. Accordingly, for the settlement of existing \\nInternational Sovereign Bonds, budget allocations are required to record the \\ntransaction in the government book of acco unts.  \\nAccordingly, for the implementation of foreign debt restructuring and settlement \\nof International Sovereign Bonds under foreign debt restructuring, I propose to \\nallocate Rs. 3,000 billion through this budget.  \\n \\n70. Stabilization of financial sector  \\nThe government is keen to ensure that all prudent measures are taken for long -\\nterm banking stability. To this end, for systemically important banks, an \\nindependent asset quality review supported by the IMF program was conducted. \\nThe preliminary results of this asset quality review indicate the need to build \\nadditional capital accumulation on a prudent basis. Accordingly, I propose to \\nallocate Rs. 450 billion to support the capital improvement process in the banking \\nsystem.  \\nThe proposed provision to improve the capital of the banking sector will ensure \\nthe stability of the banking sector in the long run. I propose that 20 percent of the \\nshares of the two large state -owned banks should be given to strategic investors \\nor the pu blic to improve capital and support the future growth of the two state -\\nowned banks to reduce the burden on taxpayers\\' funds. In parallel, a number of \\nreform measures are being implemented, including stricter rules on credit risk, 34 \\n such as stricter rules on the appointment of chief officers and state bank board \\nmembers, and restrictions on individual borrowers, to prevent future financial \\ndeterioration of state -owned banks. Amendments to the Banking Act will provide \\nthe legal framewo rk for these reforms and are expected to be passed in early 2024.  \\n \\n71. Increase in the borrowing limit  \\nBank recapitalization and external debt restructuring will require the issuance of \\nnew debt instruments with longer maturities. Therefore, budget allocations are \\nneeded to settle the existing debt and the borrowing limit needs to be increased. \\nAccordingly, I propose to increase the borrowing limit from Rs. 3,900 billion to \\nRs. 7,350 billion by Rs. 3,450 billion.  \\n \\n72. Law reforms  \\nThe Microfinance and Credit Regulatory Authority Bill and the Secured \\nTransactions Bill have already been tabled in Parliament, and the new \\nMicrofinance Bill will provide more secure legal powers for clients. The new \\nSecured Transactions Act will enable SM Es to leverage more of their assets and \\naccess loans for growth.  \\nThe Ministry of Finance is introducing new laws to further improve the principles \\nof good governance in Public Financial Management. The Public Debt \\nManagement Act, Public Financial Management Act, Public Asset Management \\nAct, Public Enterprise Reform Law have already been finalized and are scheduled \\nto be tabled in Parliament in December or in the first quarter of 2024. We initiated \\nthe introduction of the new Investment Law and Public Private Partnership Law \\nto create an investment -friendly legal environm ent. The government is \\nintroducing a new land law with new institutional changes to maximize the use \\nof land for economic development.  \\nIn addition to the above mentioned laws, we have already started the process of \\nintroducing a number of new laws and introducing amendments to the existing \\noutdated laws to support the progress of the country. In this way, we are \\nintroducing 60 new laws an d amending laws.  \\n 35 \\n 73. Governance Reforms  \\nIn contributing to the economic crisis, the government has recognized the \\nsignificant contribution made by weaknesses in economic governance and \\nespecially financial governance. The first step to solving an issue is \\nacknowledging the issue. Our government invited the International Monetary \\nFund to c onduct an independent assessment of the weaknesses in Sri Lanka\\'s \\ngovernance structures. This is the first time that a Sri Lankan government has \\nconducted such a review. Also, this is the first time that the International \\nMonetary Fund has conducted an ana lysis of governance in Asia. Sri Lanka has \\nsuffered from governance -related structural issues. The government has already \\nidentified many of the issues raised in the review and we are already taking steps \\nto address them. For example, measures to improve t he procurement process, \\naddressing corruption weaknesses in revenue collection authorities, and \\naddressing issues related to investment incentives are high priorities on the \\ngovernment\\'s agenda. Legislations are being prepared to address these issues. \\nNew legislation is being drafted in the form of the Public Financial Management \\nBill. \\n \\n74. New growth model  \\nFor several decades, Sri Lanka relied on debt -financed economic development \\nand welfare distribution. This was not a sustainable economic structure, and with \\nthe restructuring of the country\\'s debt, we have an opportunity to change this \\nmodel. Sri Lanka ne eds a new social consensus to decide, whether we want a low -\\ntax country with limited public services? Or do we need a country with more \\ngovernment involvement with more taxes? Either way, there must be \\nproductivity growth and shareable surplus for the deve lopment of the country. \\nThis new growth model should be based on a digitalized social market economy \\nwith more effectiveness, equitability and green growth.  \\n \\n75. Sri Lanka Revenue Authority  \\nWhile many efforts have been made recently to increase government revenue, \\nseveral recent reform measures have failed. Accordingly, considering \\ninternational experience to increase the effectiveness of revenue administration, \\nexpedite reforms, provide solu tions to human resources -related issues by 36 \\n avoiding obstacles such as outdated government regulations, and prepare a \\nmodern, efficient, and uninterrupted revenue administration system, I propose \\nto establish a new revenue authority. Further, it is proposed to establish a special \\nproject team under the Ministry of Finance to coordinate the establishment of this \\nrevenue authority.   \\n \\n76. Global Economic Relations  \\nThe international market should be expanded for exports. And, we have to create \\na competitive economy. For this, we are working to establish extended trade \\nagreements with our main partners in the region.  \\nWe are working to establish free trade agreements with Thailand, Indonesia, \\nBangladesh, and China. We are taking steps to expand India\\'s free trade \\nagreement into a comprehensive economic and technological cooperation \\nagreement.  \\nOn the one hand, we are entering a Regional Comprehensive Economic \\nPartnership (RCEP). On the other hand, we link with the common system of trade \\npreferences of the European Union. Therefore, our country gets opportunities to \\nenter all major global markets  at competitive levels.  \\nAs a primary step to improving Sri Lanka\\'s deeper connectivity with foreign trade \\nand global markets, we are taking steps to eliminate para tariff , including CESS  \\non imports , Port s and Airport s Development Levy. Easing of these taxes will be \\nphased out through 3 to 5 years.  \\nSri Lanka\\'s trade facilitation obligations of the World Trade Organization are \\nlower than many less developed countries. Several government institutions have \\nnot reached those goals while the selected trade facilitation measures such as \\naccepting electronic payments and accepting digital documents are to be \\ncompleted.  \\nTherefore, the National Trade Facilitation Committee will be established under \\nthe chairmanship of the Secretary  to the Treasury . We also hope to include some \\nother stakeholders in the committee.  \\nSteps will be taken to further modernize the customs laws to prepare the customs \\nlaws of Sri Lanka according to global best practices.  37 \\n The National Committee for Effective Trade Facilitation is important for speedy \\nimplementation of the National Single Window. It can have a positive impact on \\ninternal trade and investment. The National Single Window will bring all border \\nmanagement agenci es into a single digital platform and facilitate trade -related \\nregulatory documentation in a seamless and timely manner. An amount of Rs. \\n200 million has been  allocated for those works.  \\nRegistering trademarks in several countries is costly in terms of time and money. \\nWe are working to accede to the Madrid Convention which will make the \\nregistration quickly and easily. This is crucial to increase the competitiveness of \\nSri Lankan brands an d increase the value of Sri Lankan export products.  \\n \\n77. Investments  \\nAs proposed in last year\\'s budget, the government has taken steps to reform the \\ninstitutional and legal framework to promote and facilitate investment and trade \\nin the country. Accordingly, a new joint investment law has been drafted \\nestablishing a Infrastructure Corporation  that oversees the institutional \\nframework that integrates the functions of the Board  of Investment , Export \\nDevelopment Board, Industrial Development Board, and National Enterprises \\nDevelopment Authority. For the establishment of the Infrastructure Corpo ration, \\nI propose to allocate Rs . 250 million.  \\nWe expect to facilitate the investors by enhancing the automation of functions of \\nall government agencies providing services to investors and linking with relevant \\napproval or licensing authorities through simplification of relevant procedures, \\ninteroperab ility, reduced cost, and time -consuming procedures. Rs. 100 million  \\nhas been allocated  for this purpose in 2024.  \\nI propose to establish new investment zones centered in Hambantota, Jaffna, \\nTrincomalee, Bingiriya, and Kandy. I also propose to control these specific \\ninvestment promotion zones through the Infrastructure Corporation . \\n \\n78. Improving productivity and steering production economies  \\nAs I mentioned in the 2023 budget speech, the legislation to set up a National \\nProductivity Commission has already been drafted and finalized. This 38 \\n commission is to be established by 2024. For this a provision of Rs. 150 million \\nwill be allocated in 2024.  \\n \\n79. Towards a Digital Economy  \\nI propose to restructure the organizational structure related to information \\ntechnology in the public sector to facilitate the digital economy by the year 2030.  \\nAccordingly, efforts are being made to establish a digital authority with full \\npowers to provide the necessary leadership and direction for the digitization of \\nthe public sector.  \\nIn addition, I also propose to establish a technological innovation council to \\nencourage technological innovation in coordination with the public sector, expert \\ninstitutions and civil society.  \\nAlso, steps will be taken to establish a National Center for Artificial Intelligence \\nto ensure an economic and social transformation, based on the latest trends in \\ndigital technology, and artificial intelligence . \\nAn amount of  Rs. 3 billion is allocated to implement these activities for the next \\nyear.  \\nA critical backbone for this infrastructure will be the development of Sri Lanka\\'s \\ndigital identity. Steps have been taken to reach this goal and it is expected to be \\ncompleted in the year 2024.  \\n \\n80. National Research Policy for Research in Sri Lanka  \\nResearch and development, technological advancement and innovation, play an \\nimportant role as a catalyst in promoting economic growth and supporting \\neconomic progress and social well -being. I propose to formulate a national \\nresearch policy based on those f acts. I propose to allocate Rs. 8 billion for this \\npurpose.  \\n \\n81. Tourism Industry  39 \\n After the economic crisis, the tourism industry is making a progress. We need to \\nmake a number of changes in the field of tourism based on the location, climate, \\nand historical heritage of our country. We have to create a new tourism culture \\nby overcoming the traditional functions of renting hotel rooms, providing spaces \\nto enjoy beach experiences and showing Sigiriya. A number of steps that lay the \\nfoundation for that are included in this budget document.  \\nIt is expected to implement a long -term program in a new form under “Visit Sri \\nLanka” from 2024 to promote the tourism sector. Our expectation is to bring at \\nleast five million tourists to Sri Lanka every year. To facilitate this, the \\ngovernment, provincia l councils, and local government institutions should do a \\nlot of work. Also, we are working to adopt a new law regarding the tourism \\nsector. A provision of one billion rupees is given for these works.  \\nThe responsibilities of meeting the basic needs of the tourism sector are assigned \\nto the Provincial Councils. Provincial tourism boards are being strengthened for \\nthat. An amount of Rs. 750  million is allocated for the development of related \\ninfrastructure. The necessary support is given to the Provincial Councils through \\nthe Finance Commission.  \\nThere are more than 720 government -owned resorts and tourist bungalows. This \\ncan provide approximately 3,750 rooms. I also propose to prepare a program to \\nattract local and foreign tourists by modernizing the government resorts and \\nusing them to promote tourism. I propose to allocate Rs. 600 million for these \\ndevelopment activities.  \\n \\n \\n82. Pinnawala - Kithulgala Tourism Corridor  \\nKithulgala Water rafting Area, Pinnawala Elephant Orphanage and other tourist \\nattractions around it are being developed as tourist zone. The Rambukkanana \\nentrance of the Central Expressway is used for that purpose. The proposed \\nGaligamuwa New Town is being  promoted as the hub of this tourism region. An \\namount of Rs. 750 million is allocated to implement this project as a joint program \\nwithin a period of 3 years.  \\n \\n 40 \\n 83. The creative economy  \\nCreativity plays an important role in culture and society. The foundation of the \\ncreative economy is technology and innovation. Therefore, I invite relevant \\nstakeholders to take the lead in creating collaboration between creative spaces, \\nindustry and acade mia. The government is ready to assist in building the creative \\neconomy of Sri Lanka.  \\n \\n84. Gig economic affairs  \\nConsidering the new trends in gig economy activities and e -commerce \\ntransactions, including cross -border transactions of goods and services, it is \\nproposed to introduce a simple policy and regulatory framework to facilitate gig \\neconomy and e -commerce trans actions, including cross -border transactions. It \\ncovers the areas of payment system, fiscal revenue, and employee welfare.  \\n \\n85. Green economy  \\nWe need to create a green economy in Sri Lanka to face the future with strength. \\nThe climate  prosperity plan is the basis for the future vision of the sustainable \\ndevelopment agenda.  \\nBy establishing a Climate Finance Unit in the Treasury and a Climate Change \\nOffice in the President\\'s Office, steps are being taken to create the institutional \\nstructure that will support the implementation of Sri Lanka\\'s Climate Prosperity \\nPlan.  \\nWe have allocated 600 acres of land beyond the Kothmale Reservoir to establish \\nan International Climate Change University.  \\nSri Lanka is working hard to develop renewable energy sources including green \\nhydrogen, green ammonia, and solar and wind.  \\nWe are working to establish a climate change commission soon.  \\nIt is predicted that food shortages may occur in several countries in the Asian \\nregion due to climate change. In this situation, I propose to allocate Rs. 250 million \\nto launch a suitable program to ensure food security in the future and supply of \\nessentia l food to consumers without shortage and to provide technical and other 41 \\n facilities required by small and medium -scale processors engaged in the food \\nproduction process.   \\nWe want to create a green economy that protects trees and greens, environment..!  \\nWe want to create a green society that loves the trees and greens, environment...!  \\nWe were able to present a green budget that would create a green economy and \\na green society. It is a green budget that strengthens the country\\'s future.  \\nThis green budget is an approach to a new economy. A prelude to a strong future. \\nA confirmation of the concept of ”Samajee wikatha ”. \\n \\nConclusion  \\nWe were able to present a budget that will strengthen the country\\'s future despite \\nthere are many problems. But in this journey, there are a number of other \\nproblems in front of us that must be faced and overcome. There are no beautiful \\nanswers to these qu estions. Creating fairy worlds will not solve these problems. \\nWe have to find answers to these questions gradually and scientifically. These \\nissues should be resolved without breaking the concept of  “Samajeewikatha ”. That \\nis the challenging work we are doi ng now.  \\nWhat will happen if we terminate this practice as suggested by some opposition \\ngroups? Or what will happen if this practice is interrupted and disrupted? The \\nseries of reforms carried out with the support of the International Monetary Fund \\nwill stop. If that happens, the debt restructuring operation will come to a \\nstandstill. Confidence is broken and foreign exchange flow into the local banking \\nsystem will stop. With the shortage of foreign exchange comes the shor tage of \\nessential goods. Power cuts, fuel shortages occur again. The prices of goods and \\ninflation are rising beyond imagination.  \\nSince the International Monetary Fund program was approved in March, the \\nforeign income we started receiving again will halt. The government will have to \\nborrow more from the domestic market by raising interest rates again.  \\nIf that happens, we will slide back into economic hell. Our economy is derailed \\nbeyond repair. Remember! If that happens again, no one in the world will come \\nforward to save Sri Lanka. The trust placed in us by all parties, including our 42 \\n external creditors, the International Monetary Fund, is broken. We are inheriting \\nthe unfortunate situation that happened to a country like Lebanon.  \\nIn order not to fall back into such a situation, the economic and political system \\nof our country must be created anew. A new social consensus should be \\nestablished. What we have done in this budget document is to lay the foundation \\nfor it.  \\nWe can no longer become a nation dependent on others. After independence, our \\nfirst development project, the Gal Oya campaign, was carried out with our own \\nfunds. At that time we also gave loans to Britain. But today we are begging in \\nfront of the whole wo rld. Should we give the next generation a poor legacy? Or a \\nproud possession?  \\nSo, I request all the parties of this House to join the work order to rebuild the \\ncountry. If there is a better program than ours, present it to this House in detail. \\nLet\\'s discuss. Let\\'s implement the most suitable program. Let\\'s inherit a proud \\ntitle for  our future generations.  \\nI am particularly thankful for the instructions given by the Honorable Prime \\nMinister for the presentation of this year\\'s budget. Ministers of State Hon. Ranjith \\nSiyalapitiya and Hon. Shehan Semasinghe always give me their maximum \\nsupport. Thanks to them b oth. For this year\\'s budget, many people from the \\npublic and private sectors, including honorable members of this House, gave their \\nopinions and suggestions. I also express my thanks to them.

Since independence, the country has, for many decades, run large \\nbudget deficits where government expenditure exceeds government revenue. \\nThis is evident in the fact that th e country has run a primary budget surplus in \\nonly 5 years since independence – namely 1954, 1955, 1992, 2017, and 2018. In \\naddition, the country has been running significant current account deficits in the \\nbalance of payments, indicating that Sri Lanka ha s been living beyond its means.  \\nGovernment expenditure over the decades have typically comprised spending on \\nwages and pensions of state employees (including healthcare workers, teachers, \\nmilitary and public security, and public administration), welfare payments \\n(fertilizer subsidies, so cial safety nets such as Samurdhi/Janasaviya, debt service \\ncosts, and capital expenditure (roads, power supply, water supply, irrigation, \\nports and airports etc.).  \\nSri Lanka’s government expenditure is largely a reflection of the informal social \\ncontract in the country where the majority of citizens expect the government to \\nprovide a large volume of public services and substantially participate in \\neconomic activity. This is in the form of universal free education, free healthcare, \\nsubstantial public welfare measures such as subsidised fertilizer, public \\ntransport, and utilities. The government has also become the employer of last \\nresort, with the public service now re aching close to 1. 3 million individuals, most \\nof whom have non -contributory pensions. Governments that have significantly \\ndeviated from these norms in the past have typically faced electoral punishment. \\nA lack of fiscal discipline became the norm over several decades.  \\nFiscal Trends: A build -up of debt over many decades   \\nIn the 1980s, capital expenditure accounted for around 43% of total public \\nspending, this ratio dropped to 25% in the 1990s and capital expenditure has \\nremained under 25% of total public spending during the 2000s. Therefore, 75% of \\npublic expenditure has b een on recurrent spending in the above areas (salaries, \\npensions, welfare, interest) which was required to fulfil the informal social \\ncontract and largely non -discretionary in nature. This has hindered the \\ngovernment’s effective contribution in generating long term economic growth to \\ncreate opportunities for the masses.  55 \\n Between 1960 and 1992, the government revenue to GDP ratio dropped below \\n20% only in two years – 1977 and 1982 (both years 19.7% of GDP). At the time, \\ngovernment revenue was supported by taxes on surplus of export plantation \\ncommodities. During the same pe riod, government expenditure dropped below \\n25% only in 2 years. In fact between 1978 and 1991, government expenditure did \\nnot drop below 30% of GDP.  \\nIn the 30 years between 1979 and 2009, the government budget deficit dropped \\nbelow 7% of GDP in only 4 years and never dropped below 6% of GDP. These \\nbudget deficits are the outcome of public expenditure over and above successive \\ngovernments’ ability to co llect tax revenues. These deficits accumulate over the \\nyears resulting in the build -up of public debt, as the country lived beyond its \\nmeans.  \\nFinancing Debt  \\nBudget deficits have to be financed by borrowing either from the domestic market \\nsources (Treasury bills and bonds, the state bank overdrafts, or Central Bank \\nfinancing, known as monetary financing), or from foreign sources. This balance \\nhas to be carefull y managed since excess borrowing from the domestic market \\ncan cause interest rates to increase and suppress economic growth. Alternatively, \\nexcess financing from the Central Bank will cause inflation to accelerate and \\ndestroy wealth and purchasing power of  citizens.  \\nLikewise, excess borrowing from foreign sources can create repayment pressures \\nwhich if not matched by equal growth in external non -debt creating inflows \\n(exports of goods/services and FDI), will cause balance of payments issues and \\ncurrency crises.    \\nSri Lanka was able to finance these large budget deficits in the 1980s and 1990s \\nthrough low cost concessionary financing from donors such as the World Bank, \\nAsian Development Bank, Government of Japan and so on. These funds were \\nraised at very low rates ( often 0% to 2% interest) with typical grace periods \\naround 10 years and repayment horizons exceeding 30 years.  \\nSuch concessional debt financing created only moderate external account \\npressures and enabled governments to manage cash flow needs without relying \\non significant domestic resource mobilisation (domestic tax base). This was \\npossible until around 2006 when Sri Lanka per capita GDP exceeded USD 2,000. \\nCrossing this threshold reduced Sri Lanka’s access to low -cost concessionary \\nfinancing from traditional donors.   \\nAt this point, Sri Lanka had two choices; 1) reduce budget deficits and thus reduce \\nfinancing needs 2) shift emphasis from foreign borrowings to domestic 56 \\n borrowings. Sri Lanka however chose a third option, which was to continue with \\nhigh budget deficits but to switch to alternative sources of foreign financing \\nwhich was commercial markets and other non -traditional bilateral lenders. The \\nformer was used to f inance the general budget deficit and the latter was typically \\nused for project financing.  \\nExternal commercial financial took place in the form of typically long term, for \\nexample, 10 year international sovereign bonds, short term foreign investment in \\nrupee bills and bonds, and a smaller volume of syndicated loa ns. The sovereign \\nbonds and typical bilateral financing had maturity periods of roughly 10 years.  \\nThis period coincided with a very conducive external environment where global \\nfinancial markets were flush with abundant liquidity following the response to \\nthe global financial crisis of 2008, and investors were more than happy to invest \\nin hitherto untap ped frontier economies like Sri Lanka in search of higher interest \\nrates.   \\nTherefore, between 2007 (when the first international sovereign bond was issued) \\nand around 2018, there was limited pressure on external finances in terms of \\nrepayment of maturities of these debt instruments and in terms of ability to roll -\\nover debt. From 2019 onwards, as the new sources of external debt began to \\nmature, Sri Lanka’s external debt repayments ballooned to USD 4 -6 billion per \\nannum. Just a few years prior to that, external debt repayments were typically \\nunder USD 1 billion per annum.  \\n \\nDebt Repayment Pressures  \\nDuring the period leading up to the sharp increase in debt repayments (from 2019 \\nonwards), Sri Lanka should have taken steps to build up repayment capacity. \\nThat would be in the form of running primary budget surpluses by improving \\nthe domestic tax revenue  base, and running current account surpluses in the \\nbalance of payments to support external debt repayments1. \\nHowever, for the most part, the status quo remained. While there was a dramatic \\nchange in the country’s financing options, there was little or no change in the \\ncountry’s spending and savings behaviour. Successive governments continued to \\n \\n1 Running primary surpluses and current account surpluses requires a balance of fiscal policy and \\nmonetary policy that encourages savings over consumption. This typically means enhanced \\ngovernment revenue and moderate spending to minimise government dissavin g, and positive \\nreal interest rates to encourage private savings.         \\n 57 \\n run large budget deficits and current account deficits and fiscal consolidation \\nefforts were not a permanent feature of fiscal policy.  \\nWhile current account deficits improved from an average of 7.7% of GDP in the \\n1980s to 4.8% of GDP in the 1990s and 4.1% of GDP in the ten years leading up to \\n2015, the deficits remained too high to support a sustainable external account. The \\nexternal defi cit in the balance of payments had to be filled by foreign borrowings.   \\nThe last two decades also coincided with a period where exports as a percentage \\nof GDP were on the decline. High border taxes, over -valued exchange rates, and \\nhigh consumption to savings ratios all contributed to the anti -export bias that \\ncompounded curren t account challenges.  \\nWhen tax revenue should have been gradually increased, the opposite happened. \\nSince 1996, government revenue to GDP declined from 20.1% to 11.9% of GDP by \\n2019. Government expenditure has remained in the range of 20% of GDP since \\n2010 – which is not excess ive compared with regional and income peers, and Sri \\nLanka is in fact lower than these averages.  \\nBy 2019, the accumulated central government debt had reached 82% of GDP. The \\neconomy was generating diminishing levels of tax revenue compared to the level \\nof expenditure that it had to sustain to maintain the informal social contract. Until \\n2019, it was a lso possible to raise external financing without having to face the \\nconsequences in terms of repayments of the same.  \\n \\nSOEs and Complex Macroeconomic Interactions  \\nIn fact, total debt was higher than 82% since a further debt of 7% of GDP was \\nparked in state owned enterprises. This is the result of persistent losses \\naccumulated in large state owned enterprises – particularly the Ceylon Petroleum \\nCorporation (CPC), the  Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), and Sri Lankan Airlines.  \\nLosses in the CPC and CEB have resulted due to the failure of successive \\ngovernments to ensure cost recovery pricing of utilities. Both entities face costs \\nlargely due to exogenous factors (global fuel and coal prices) and cost of past debt, \\nbeyond the con trol of the management or government. But public expectations \\nhave been that such costs should not be passed on to consumers of these products \\nand governments adhered to such public pressures.  \\nAs a result, prices of fuel and electricity have regularly below cost recovery levels, \\nleading to build up of losses at these entities. The below cost pricing also resulted \\nin over -consumption of such products, compounding the current account deficit \\nof th e balance of payments (fuel being Sri Lanka’s single largest import).  58 \\n The SOE losses were also not regularly funded by government transfers. Instead, \\nthe losses were financed by the state -owned banks. However, in a situation where \\nselling prices were constantly below cost, the CEB and CPC could not make a \\nsurplus to enable s ettlement of bank debts.  \\nTherefore, the SOE debts kept accumulating at the banks as well – threatening the \\nstability of the state banks. Most of the bank loans were required to fund raw \\nmaterial imports of these SOEs and were in foreign currency. Therefore, the banks \\nhad to keep b orrowing alternative sources of foreign currency from overseas \\ncounterparties to be able to fund the CEB/CPC forex loans on their balance \\nsheets. This debt cycle was only possible as long as external financing lines \\nremained open.  \\nDebts also accumulated between the different SOEs. For instance, due to lack of \\nelectricity tariff revisions, the CEB did not have sufficient revenue to pay the full \\ncost of fuel purchased from the CPC. Sri Lankan Airlines also accumulated large \\narrears to  the CPC. These issues have been compounded by governance and \\nmanagement issues of SOEs’ lack of commercial orientation for the purpose of \\nachieving sustainability and financial viability. This created a complex and \\ndangerous cocktail of debt accumulation across different sections of the economy \\n– most importantly creating increasing risks in the financial sector.     \\nSuccessive governments tried to achieve welfare objectives by suppressing \\nmarket prices, leading to large losses at SOEs and resultant adverse fiscal and \\nfinancial sector spillovers. Welfare objectives should have been addressed by \\ntargeted direct cash tra nsfers instead. Weak governance and lack of fiscal \\ndiscipline characterized successive governments in recent decades. Continuous \\nbreaches of the Fiscal Management Responsibility Act, institutional weaknesses \\nand corruption vulnerabilities in revenue collec tion departments, and abuse of \\ninvestment incentive schemes are just a few examples of such fiscal governance \\nissues.  \\nThe above history of the last few decades outlines how Sri Lanka has attempted \\nto sustain a large public sector and government footprint demanded by its \\ninformal social contract, using ever diminishing government revenues. The \\nresultant imbalances were fun ded by external debt which were increasingly \\nexpensive on increasingly challenging payment terms. These structural \\nimbalances resulted in a perilous equilibrium, leaving the country highly \\nvulnerable to any shocks.  \\n \\n 59 \\n The 2021/2022 Economic Crisis  \\nIn 2016, Sri Lanka entered its 16th IMF programme considering the challenges \\nexpected during the subsequent period. A revenue based fiscal consolidation \\nprogramme commenced with increases in VAT to 15% and personal income taxes \\nbeing increased to a top rate of 24% and the standard corporate  tax rate being \\nincreased to 28% (albeit with most sectors subject to a concessionary rate of 14% \\nincluding all SMEs, exports, tourism, IT, agriculture, and education).  \\nA primary surplus in the budget was achieved in 2017 and 2018 (although \\nincluding some arrears) and revenue to GDP saw a gradual increase from a low \\nof 11.2% in 2014. The government at the time expected to gradually restore fiscal \\nsustainability and ensure  debt sustainability during the upcoming period of \\nelevated debt maturities. A key priority was to maintain credit ratings in order to \\nensure financial market access to safely roll -over maturing external debt.  \\nIn mid -2020, the IMF programme was abruptly abandoned. VAT was reduced to \\n8%, personal income tax was reduced to 18% with high thresholds and corporate \\ntax rates were reduced to 24% with further expansion of concessionary rates \\nincluding 0 rate for IT and agro -farming. With the change in fiscal policy \\ntrajectory, credit rating agencies reacted adversely and Sri Lanka’s credit ratings \\nwere downgraded locking the country out of global capital markets by early 2020. \\nIn fact, in December 2019, shortly after the  tax cuts were announced, Fitch ratings \\nchanged the rating outlook on Sri Lanka to negative, citing the ramifications of \\nthe tax cuts for debt sustainability and since then, there was a series of rating \\ndowngrades until early 2022.  \\nIt was in this context that the COVID -19 pandemic hit the economy. The resultant \\nlockdowns and freezing of economic activity caused government revenues to \\ncrash and the budget deficit ballooned to double digit levels. With the credit \\nrating downgrades, Sri  Lanka was not able to raise external financing to fund the \\nrising budget deficits. The government also took the position that interest rates \\nshould remain at single digit levels to support economic activity. Funding the \\nentire deficit through the domestic  Treasury bond and bill market would have \\ncaused interest rates to escalate. Therefore, the government began funding most \\nof the budget deficit directly through the central bank by monetary financing.  \\nDuring the first half of 2020 the government approached the IMF to access a Rapid \\nFinancing Instrument which was provided by the IMF to several dozen countries \\nto mitigate the impacts of the pandemic. However, at that time, the government \\nwas informed that  Sri Lanka’s debt was unsustainable and that the IMF could not \\nlend to the country unless steps were taken to restructure public debt. The 60 \\n government at the time did not wish to take that path, choosing instead a “home -\\ngrown solution”.  \\n \\nHome -grown Solution  \\nOver the next two years, the government continued to fund the double digit \\nbudget deficit through domestic financing with a significant component of \\nmonetary financing. In the absence of foreign financing, it was not possible to roll -\\nover maturing external  debt, therefore the country’s foreign exchange reserves \\nwere used to settle maturing debt. Foreign exchange reserves began to gradually \\ndiminish from around USD 7.6 billion at the end of 2019.  \\nDuring this time, current account inflows to the balance of payments had also \\ndried up due to the lack of tourism earnings during the pandemic. From mid -\\n2021, remittances also began to reduce since the government pegged the Rupee \\nat the rate of 203/USD, wh ilst informal markets offered significantly higher rates, \\nattracting remaining remittances away from formal banking channels. Adding \\nmore pressures, confidence of the investors, foreign partners and even of the \\nexpatriates was lost aggravating the drying u p of foreign inflows.  \\nIn the second half of 2021, as official foreign exchange reserves had declined \\nbelow USD 3 bn, the shortages of foreign currency liquidity in the banking sector \\nbegan to translate into shortages of essential imported commodities. Long queues \\nbegan to form for products such as cooking gas. The situation continued to \\nescalate as the government found it impossible to raise external financing due to \\nthe weak credit rating of CCC or below.  \\nAt the same time, the favourable global liquidity conditions of the last decade and \\na half had begun to reverse as global Central Banks entered a tightening regime \\nfollowing the end of the Covid -19 pandemic. In March 2022, the Federal Reserve \\nbegan raising  rates, rapidly taking liquidity out of global markets. The other \\nglobal central banks also followed the suit.     \\nBy early 2022, the forex shortages reached extreme proportions. There were \\nseveral defaults in the inter -bank foreign exchange market and defaults on letters \\nof credit. External financing lines to the banks came to a halt and the inter -bank \\nmarket all but froze as well. Opening LCs was no longer an option to fund \\nessential imports. It was with great difficulty that a banking crisis was averted \\nduring that time.  \\nShortages of fuel reached such an extent that people had to queue for four to five \\ndays to obtain 10 litres of petrol or diesel. Power cuts ran up to 13 hours. Essential \\nmedicines were in short supply. Some people died while waiting in queues.  61 \\n Images of the few tourists remaining in the country dining in darkness in their \\nhotels were aired around the world. The crippling supply chain disruptions \\nupended the manufacturing and agricultural sectors which was already in \\ntrouble due to the lack of fe rtilizer. The lack of fertilizer threatened to result in a \\nmajor food crisis by the second half of the year, particularly since there was no \\nforeign exchange to import food in case of domestic production shortfalls.  \\nInflation began to gallop as supply chain disruptions were the fuel added to 2 \\nyears of extensive monetary financing that led to significant demand pressures. \\nAs prices spiralled, the real income and wealth of the citizens, particularly the \\npoor and vulner able, was eroded day by day. Eventually, inflation peaked at a \\nSri Lankan record of 70% in September 2022.  \\nIn March 2022, the steady trickle of protests gained momentum and spilled over \\ninto mass scale public protests. On the 18th of March 2022, President Gotabaya \\nRajapaksa officially wrote to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) with Request \\nfor an IMF Engagement in Sri Lanka, which was reinforced through another letter \\nto the IMF on the 07th of April 2022 with a Request for an Appropriate Fund \\nSupported Programme to Sri Lanka. The Cabinet of Ministers resigned, as did the \\nGovernor of the Central Bank and the Secretary to the Treasury. A new Central \\nBank Governor and Secretary to the Treasury were appointed in the first week of \\nApril 2022.  \\nBy the 11th of April, usable foreign currency reserves had dwindled to USD 24 \\nmillion. The following week after the new near holidays, there was a debt service \\npayment of USD 182 million on the 18th of April. The Central Bank also had short \\nterm commitments to pay for fuel, coal, and other essential imports amounting to \\nover USD 500 million. Foreign currency debt repayments for the rest of the year \\n2022 amounted to USD 4.3 billion. Sri Lanka had run out of options and the \\ngovernment had to declare a unilate ral moratorium on selected external debt \\npayments pending the restructure of its debts. The country was officially \\nbankrupt.  \\nEconomic Rescue  \\nWhile adopting aggressive policy measures since April 2022, Sri Lanka entered \\ninto negotiations with the IMF to implement an economic reform programme that \\nwould address the structural imbalances deeply entrenched in the Sri Lankan \\neconomy. This was not li ke an ordinary programme where the negotiation is \\nbetween the government and the IMF – in such programmes, like in 2016, there \\nis a fair degree of flexibility in negotiating terms. Sri Lanka unfortunately lost that \\nchance when the programme was abandoned i n 2019.  62 \\n The 2022 programme was from a position of unsustainable debt, and therefore, \\nSri Lanka needed to ask its creditors to accept losses on their claims on Sri Lankan \\ndebt. As a result, the economic reforms undertaken had to also demonstrate to \\nexternal credito rs that the country was making deep and meaningful reforms that \\nthey were willing to support by accepting losses on their claims.  \\nThe most important aspect of Sri Lanka’s engagement with the IMF was the fact \\nthat it provides an anchor of credibility to the economic path the country is taking. \\nWithout that credibility, external actors; both government and private, would not \\nbe willing  to engage with Sri Lanka in terms of financial assistance or even trade \\ncredit. Given the prevailing economic context even in November 2023, a deviation \\nfrom that path would undermine the credibility of the economic path and once \\nagain cut off Sri Lanka’s  access to external finance.  \\nThe immediate priority was to address the deep fiscal imbalances. Even \\nregardless of the IMF programme and debt restructuring, the government’s fiscal \\ncashflows were simply not sustainable without a substantial increase in revenue \\ngeneration to enable the provision of even basic public services. Government \\nexpenditure is predominantly rigid non -discretionary spending items. Whatever \\nlimited savings can be gained through greater efficiencies and discipline in \\nprocurement and capital expenditure will not be s ufficient to bridge the wide \\nfiscal gap.  \\nTreasury Cash Flow Pressures  \\nEven with the reforms that have been put in place as of November 2023, in the \\nupcoming year each month, the Treasury must find Rs. 93 billion to pay public \\nsector salaries, Rs. 70 billion to pay pensions and public welfare including free \\nmedicines, Aswesum a, and Rs. 220 billion to pay monthly interest cost. Just these \\nthree items require Rs. 383 billion per month. None of these spending items can \\nbe easily reduced in the short term. In comparison, in the first 9 months of 2023, \\nmonthly tax revenue was Rs. 2 15 billion. This is before consideration of debt \\nrepayments and essential capital investments.  \\nIn the past, it was possible to finance this kind of budget deficit with borrowing \\nfrom foreign sources, with overdrafts from the state banks, and when that was \\nnot available, to directly fund the debt through the Central Bank (money \\nprinting). Today, ther e is very limited foreign financing available until debt is \\nrestructured, the state bank overdraft is reduced from over Rs. 900 billion in 2021 \\nto Rs. 70 billion at present, and central bank financing is disallowed under the \\nnew CBSL Act.  63 \\n Tax Reforms  \\nTherefore, until government revenue improves from the present 10% of GDP to a \\nsustainable level of at least 15% of GDP, it will not be possible to avoid another \\ncrisis in the near future. It is in this context that the government has had no option \\nbut to i ncrease tax collection. In doing so, the emphasis has been to maximise \\nrevenue from progressive direct taxes such as corporate and personal income \\ntaxes and to focus on a simple structure of a few core taxes, including VAT and \\ncore excises (tobacco, alcoho l, fuel).  \\nWith regard to personal income taxes, the tax structure was developed based on \\nthe official Household Income and Expenditure Survey data. Accordingly, with a \\ntax free threshold of Rs. 100,000/month still only the top 20% of the Sri Lankan \\npopulation are su bject to personal income tax. It is very challenging for Sri Lankan \\nauthorities to negotiate with the IMF and creditors requesting tax reductions on \\nthe top 20% of the population within less than a year of formally commencing the \\nIMF programme.  \\nThe VAT rate will be increased up to 18% in January 2024 along with elimination \\nof almost all VAT exemptions other than for products relating to health, \\neducation, and a few essential foods. This brings Sri Lanka in line with regional \\npeers including India  and Pakistan, in terms of standard VAT rate. Once the \\nresulting VAT collections enable overall tax targets to be met, it will be possible \\nto phase out other indirect taxes such as the Social Security Contribution levy \\n(SSCL) and rationalise the Special Co mmodity levy (SCL), which are distortive in \\nnature.  \\nTax Compliance and Administration  \\nWhilst increasing tax rates have been essential to bridge the cash flow deficit and \\nenable the delivery of basic public services, a sustainable increase in revenue \\nrequires significant improvements in tax administration and compliance. Several \\nmeasures hav e begun implementation with a view to improving tax \\nadministration. This requires deep institutional reform, extensive digitisation, \\nand a substantial shift in mindset within and outside the relevant departments.  \\nHere again, it is not pragmatic to expect an overnight change in deep seated \\nlegacy issues and structural problems that have become embedded over several \\ndecades. Measures have now begun to fast track digitisation by minimising \\nhuman interaction. Long over due arrears for the Revenue Administration \\nManagement Information System (RAMIS) have now been settled enabling \\nimplementation by December this year. Professional bodies hitherto outside the \\ntax net have now been registered. Integration between the Inland Revenue \\nDepartment and key government authorities such as the Land Registry, 64 \\n Department of Motor Traffic, financial institutions, CRIB, is now being fast \\ntracked to improve compliance.  \\nTax authorities are also accelerating efforts to collect past due taxes, with specific \\ntargets being set. However, it must be kept in mind that most of these past due \\ntaxes are subject to legal dispute. Until due legal process is complete, it will not \\nbe p ossible to claim whatever revenue is legally due to the government.  \\nThese compliance measures will improve Sri Lanka’s revenue collection in the \\ncoming years – but it will take some time for the expected targets to be met. Until \\nsuch time, the government has had no option but to increase tax rates in order to \\nbridge the fi nancing gap and to be able to fund basic public services. It should be \\nevident that there is very little leeway or policy options available other than the \\nmeasures that are currently being adopted by the Sri Lankan authorities.  \\nSOE Reforms: Addressing Complex Interactions with Banks  \\nSimilarly, there is little or no option with regard to ensuring that electricity and \\nfuel are priced in a manner that fully reflects costs. Due to mispricing, the CPC \\nand CEB consistently ran losses until by 2022 CPC’s debt approached a trillion \\nrupees and  CEB debt approached Rs. 800 billion. At this point the state banks \\nwere no longer able to finance the working capital requirements of these two \\nentities and supply of electricity and fuel would have come to a standstill until \\ncost-reflective pricing for t he two entities was implemented.  \\nThe government is now in the process of restructuring the debts accumulated by \\nthese SOEs on the books of the state banks. When these debts are restructured, \\nthe banks may face large losses which have to be met by capital infusions from \\ntax payer funds. In  2024, the government has allocated Rs. 450 billion of tax payer \\nfunds to recapitalise the state banks. This adds to the burden of raising tax \\nrevenue to meet expenditure obligations.  Part of this recapitalisation allocation \\nis required to plug the hole c reated by debt of the CPC due to years of mispricing \\nof fuel. These mistakes cannot be repeated in the future if Sri Lanka wants to avoid \\nanother deep economic crisis.  \\nThe above example illustrates the deep inter -connections that are inherent in the \\nprevailing economic crisis. Sri Lanka has been able to avoid meeting the true costs \\nof its failure to collect sufficient taxes and continuous mis -pricing of energy by \\nparking  these debts on the balance sheets of SOEs and the state banks. However, \\nwith the crisis coming to a peak, this has all begun to unravel.  \\nDebt Restructuring  \\nThe other key challenge to restore economic stability is the process of \\nrestructuring debt. The debt restructuring process is being undertaken with three 65 \\n key debt sustainability targets i.e. reducing the public debt to GDP ratio below \\n95% of GDP by 2032, reducing gross financing needs (GFN) to below 13% of GDP \\nduring 2027 -32 period and reducing foreign debt servicing ratio below 4.5% of \\nGDP during 2027 -32 period.  \\nThere has been criticism over the policy choices made in the domestic debt \\noptimisation (DDO) process. A DDO was essential in order to meet the \\ngovernment’s target for reduction of gross financing needs given the fact that the \\nbulk of the government’s inte rest cost arises from domestic debt.  \\nContrary to popular belief, the biggest impact of the DDO has been on the state \\nbanks. The restructuring of Sri Lanka Development Bonds (SLDBs), Foreign \\nCurrency Banking Units (FCBUs), and SOE debt has already resulted in a \\nsubstantial impact on capitalisa tion of the key state banks, which is why the \\ngovernment has allocated a sum of Rs. 450 billion to recapitalise these entities in \\n2024 to ensure continued stability of the financial system. In order to reduce the \\nburden on tax payers it is essential that e xternal shareholders are allowed to \\ninfuse capital into the state banks to allow them to grow and remain a key \\ncomponent of Sri Lanka’s economic system.  \\nWhilst there has been criticism that the restructuring of Treasury bonds excluded \\nthe banking system holding of such bonds, this criticism has failed to grasp two \\nbasic points. First, over 75% of the Treasury bonds held by the banking system \\nare held by th e state banks. Restructuring these bonds would have resulted in a \\nsignificant recapitalisation requirement which would have had to be funded by \\nthe tax payer – requiring additional tax increases.  \\nSecond, the state banks have already absorbed a large impact from the DDO as \\nillustrated above due to the restructuring of their holdings of SLDBs, FCBU debt \\nto the government, and SOE debts. The DDO implemented by the government \\nstruck the most feasible b alance between sufficient debt treatment to reach the \\ndebt targets whilst ensuring the stability of the banking system and avoiding \\nfurther tax burdens on the population.   \\nComplex Policy Mix in Navigating Reforms  \\nThe inter -connected nature of the crisis is further illustrated by the fact that the \\nrestructuring of the foreign currency debt held by state banks has knock on \\nimpacts on the foreign exchange reserve collection targets of the Central Bank. \\nThe restructuri ng of bank forex debt results in a gap in the net open position \\n(NOP) of the banks which has to be bridged by the banks purchasing foreign \\ncurrency in the market. This leaves less room for the Central Bank to buy up \\nforeign exchange to build up its reserve s and ensure stable exchange rates. This \\nin turn has forced a longer period of import restrictions which hinders the 66 \\n government’s ability to enhance revenue since approximately 50% of the \\ngovernment’s tax revenue collection pre -crisis was collected at the border.     \\nThe above details underscore the extreme complexity of the policy mix required \\nto bring Sri Lanka out of this deep economic crisis. This process entails a complex \\nweb between government tax collection, interest rate and foreign exchange \\nmanagement, the key  SOEs, and the banking system. A disruption in any one of \\nthe reform measures of these multiple moving parts has the potential to unravel \\nthe entire system. The reform process requires an extensive level of coordination \\nand careful implementation.  \\nConclusion: Necessity for a New Social Contract  \\nThe reform measures implemented over the last 18 months have resulted in \\nmaterial improvements in Sri Lanka’s macroeconomic position. A primary \\nbudget deficit of 5.7% of GDP as at end 2021 has been converted into a primary \\nbudget surplus in the first half of 2023. Tax revenue grew by 50% in the first 6 \\nmonths of 2023 in spite of a deep economic recession. Inflation was reduced from \\n70% in September 2022 to 1.3% by September 2023. Foreign exchange reserves \\nhave increased to above USD 3.5 billion.  \\nThese statistics have translated into normalisation of availability of essential \\nimports. Queues and power cuts have been eliminated. Prices have stabilised \\nalbeit at a higher equilibrium to which wages will need to eventually catch up. \\nForeign exchange ma rket has seen some easing. Fertilizer availability has been \\nrestored enabling agricultural activity to normalise and food security to be \\nsecured. Economic activity can take place as normal with the restoration of supply \\nchains.  \\nNonetheless, it should be clear that whilst Sri Lanka has achieved a degree of \\neconomic stability in the current context, the country is far from a stable \\nequilibrium. There is a long way to go to address the deep -seated structural \\nimbalances in the econom y that were described earlier on. Unless these reforms \\nare undertaken, fiscal discipline becomes entrenched, and the structural \\nimbalances eliminated, Sri Lanka will necessarily slip back into a crisis much \\nworse than that experienced in 2022 given the lac k of any economic safety buffers.  \\nAny alternative solution that is prescribed would need to credibly address crucial \\nquestions such as how a primary surplus would be achieved whilst reducing \\ntaxes? How government expenditure on salaries, pensions, and social protection \\nbe reduced? How woul d interest cost be reduced without hurting state bank \\nstability? How would credit ratings be restored to secure trade financing and \\nbanking lines? In the absence of IMF supported debt restructuring how would \\nforeign financing be secured? Without foreign fi nancing how would the domestic \\ncapital market sustain government borrowing needs? How would foreign \\nexchange reserves be restored without global capital market access? How would 67 \\n electricity and fuel be priced below cost without destabilising the banking \\nsystem?  \\nHowever, in order to arrive at a sustainable solution it is also necessary for Sri \\nLanka as a country to reach a new social contract. The existing expectation that \\nthe country must sustain a large government with significant economic \\nparticipation whilst a lso maintaining one of the world’s lowest levels of taxation, \\nis simply not tenable. Sri Lanka must either choose to have a small government \\nwith only essential public services which could be sustained by a low tax regime, \\nor it must accept the need for hi gher taxes in line with regional and income peers \\nthat can sustain a government which provides an array of public services and \\nwelfare that Sri Lankans are accustomed to.  \\nWhat is undeniable is the fact that Sri Lanka can no longer carry on in a “business \\nas usual” manner. As a country we have to be able to adapt to a changing \\nenvironment or else it will be impossible to avoid a complete collapse of the \\neconomy worse than wh at was experienced in 2022. Going forward Sri Lanka \\nmust adopt a path of fiscal and macroeconomic discipline, governance \\nweaknesses and corruption vulnerabilities must be eliminated, and as a country \\nwe must strive to stand on our own feet whilst integrati ng and competing with \\nthe rest of the world. The first steps on this difficult journey have now been taken, \\nit is essential that as a country we do not go back to our past practices, and if we \\nmaintain discipline and work hard there is no doubt that due re ward will \\nmaterialise.          \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n '"
